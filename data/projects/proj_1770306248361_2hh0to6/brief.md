## Goal

Explain why global enterprise telephony has historically been fragmented, and how LoopUp addresses that fragmentation by acting as a single global cloud telephony provider for Microsoft Teams Phone, anchored on Operator Connect.

## Audience

Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision makers running Teams at scale across multiple geographies.

## Core problem to articulate

Global telephony traditionally means local PBXs, local PSTN contracts, and multiple in-country carriers. For multinationals this becomes a patchwork of suppliers, contracts, terms, prices, support processes, and compliance requirements.

## LoopUp angle

LoopUp provides a mature global cloud telephony service for Microsoft Teams Phone via Operator Connect, reducing carrier fragmentation by consolidating PSTN provision with one telco partner.

## Benefits to make tangible

- Fewer contracts and renewal cycles, simpler commercial governance
- More consistent pricing, terms, and service levels across regions
- Faster rollout for new countries and sites, less dependency on local carrier lead times
- Centralised support, incident management, and escalation
- Cleaner number management and move, add, change processes
- Reduced operational overhead for global IT and local admins

## Terminology requirements

- Use the terms Microsoft Teams Phone, Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans
- Define PSTN on first use as Public Switched Telephone Network

## Tone and structure

Business-first and pragmatic, with recognition moments before solutions. No hard sell, end with a calm resolution and a soft next step.

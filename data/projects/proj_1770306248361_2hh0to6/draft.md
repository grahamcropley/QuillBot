## When global telephony becomes a patchwork problem

If you run Microsoft Teams Phone across multiple countries, you already know the awkward truth. Voice is still anchored in local realities. Numbers are regulated locally, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is still stitched together market by market, and the "same" telephony service can behave very differently depending on where you are.

Historically, that pushed global organisations into a familiar pattern. Each region or country procured its own carrier, negotiated its own contract, and managed its own support relationship. Many also kept local PBXs in place to handle PSTN connectivity, emergency calling requirements, and local number ranges. Even when Teams became the user experience, the underlying telephony estate often remained fragmented.

That fragmentation is not just untidy architecture, it becomes a daily operational drag.

## The hidden costs of carrier fragmentation

The obvious pain is commercial overhead. Multiple suppliers means multiple renewal dates, rate cards, term structures, and billing formats. Getting a consolidated view of spend or risk becomes a monthly exercise in reconciliation.

The bigger issue is inconsistency. One country has a fast provisioning process, another has lead times that stretch into weeks. One carrier supports the features you want, another requires workarounds. Support quality varies, escalation paths vary, and the global IT team ends up acting as a translation layer between local admins and local telcos.

Then there is change. Office moves, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), new site openings, and seasonal staffing spikes all create the same question, how quickly can we add numbers, port ranges, and keep service levels predictable. With a patchwork, the answer is different in every market, so planning becomes defensive.

And when something breaks, fragmentation shows up fast. A single user issue can become three tickets, two suppliers blaming each other, and a global team trying to keep business stakeholders calm while they piece together what is actually happening.

## What changes when you treat PSTN like a global service

This is where a single-provider model matters. With Operator Connect, Microsoft has created a more direct way to connect Teams Phone to the PSTN using certified operator partners.

It sits alongside options like Direct Routing and Microsoft Calling Plans. The right choice depends on your estate and constraints, but Operator Connect is often attractive when you want to standardise operations without turning voice into a long-running integration programme.

LoopUp's approach is to remove the carrier sprawl by acting as that single operator partner across geographies. Instead of stitching together regional carriers and contracts, you standardise on one telco provider that is built to support Teams Phone at enterprise scale.

In practice, that tends to change three things.

First, governance gets simpler. Fewer contracts, fewer renewal cycles, fewer supplier reviews. Commercial terms and service levels are easier to make consistent, and finance teams get cleaner billing and reporting.

Second, operations become repeatable. The processes for number management, porting, and move, add, change work stop being reinvented country by country. Support becomes centralised, with clearer ownership for incidents and escalations.

Third, rollout becomes less risky. When you expand Teams Phone into a new region, you are not starting from scratch with a new carrier relationship and unfamiliar tooling. The aim is not to pretend every country is identical, it is to make your delivery motion consistent enough that the differences do not dominate the timeline.

## A pragmatic way to reduce complexity

Most global IT teams are not looking for novelty. They want fewer moving parts, fewer surprises, and a voice service that keeps pace with the way the business changes.

If your Teams Phone strategy is being held back by local carrier fragmentation, it is worth asking a simple question, should PSTN still be managed as dozens of local projects, or should it be treated as one global service with local compliance built in.

For many organisations, the win is that telephony becomes boring again. Fewer suppliers, clearer ownership, and a model you can repeat as the business expands.

# One global voice layer for Microsoft Teams Phone

Procurement is staring at three different renewal dates for voice services, each with its own terms and pricing model. Finance is asking why there are still carrier invoices from countries that were meant to be standardised last year. Meanwhile, your Teams rollout plan assumes voice is a tick box.

If you run Microsoft Teams Phone across multiple countries, you quickly learn that the hardest part is not the user experience. It is everything wrapped around the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the local numbers, the contracts, the compliance and the operational effort needed to keep it all working.

For years, global telephony meant building a patchwork. A local PBX here, a carrier contract there, and a growing list of country exceptions that lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. Even when organisations moved away from on premises kit, the fragmentation often stayed. The calling platform could be global, but the voice layer still looked like a map of local decisions.

That fragmentation creates real costs that do not show up in the headline carrier rate.

- Procurement never stops, different terms, pricing models, renewal dates and legal positions by country
- Governance gets messy, inconsistent numbering plans, emergency calling practices and change controls
- Operations slows down, every move, add or change becomes a coordination exercise across suppliers
- Service quality is harder to manage, no single owner for end to end performance or incident response

This is the gap LoopUp is designed to close.

LoopUp provides cloud telephony for Microsoft Teams Phone with a single telco provider model, so you are not stitching together multiple carriers to make Teams work globally. In practice, that means LoopUp can deliver PSTN connectivity to Teams users across geographies under one commercial relationship, with one operational model.

Organisations typically connect LoopUp to Microsoft Teams Phone via Operator Connect or Direct Routing, depending on their architecture preferences and where they want responsibility to sit. Either way, the goal is the same. Reduce the number of moving parts between Teams and the PSTN and make ownership clear.

The value is not abstract. It shows up in day to day execution.

First, you simplify delivery. Rolling out Teams Phone to a new country stops being a separate sourcing project. You get a repeatable pattern for numbers, porting, activation and lifecycle management.

Second, you make change safer. When there is one provider accountable for the voice layer, troubleshooting is faster and post incident learning is actionable. You can also standardise policy across sites, including how you handle numbering, routing and emergency calling.

Third, you regain commercial control. One supplier means fewer renewal cliffs, fewer hidden cost categories and less internal time spent reconciling invoices. It also makes it easier to forecast spend when you are scaling or restructuring.

Finally, you set yourself up for long term simplification. A global Teams Phone strategy only really becomes an operating model when it is supported by a global approach to PSTN connectivity, not a collection of local exceptions.

Most enterprises do not need more telephony features. They need fewer suppliers, fewer surprises and a voice layer that behaves like the rest of their cloud estate. That is what a mature, single provider approach can deliver.

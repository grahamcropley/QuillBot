## Brief (retrospective)

### What this document is

A B2B explainer comparing Microsoft Teams PSTN connectivity options—framed around the “hidden costs” of DIY voice via Direct Routing—and positioning Operator Connect as a lower-overhead alternative for many organizations.

### Target audience

IT/UC leaders, voice engineers, and procurement stakeholders responsible for Microsoft Teams Phone deployments (often in multi-site, multi-country enterprises).

### Goal

Help readers understand where Direct Routing (DIY) creates ongoing operational, compliance, and scaling costs—and when Operator Connect is the better fit—so they can choose the right model (or a mixed approach).

### Key points covered

- Teams supports four PSTN models: Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Direct Routing, and Teams Phone Mobile (with Microsoft documentation links).
- DIY Direct Routing commonly increases operational burden: SBC selection/operation, voice routing, certificates (TLS/mTLS), monitoring, incident response, and ongoing call flow maintenance.
- “Hidden costs” tend to show up in:
  - Emergency calling (addresses, dynamic locations, notifications, regional requirements)
  - Recording/compliance (policy-based recording, certified partners, storage/retention)
  - Number lifecycle management (acquisition, porting, assignment, usage changes)
  - Data residency considerations
  - Continuous policy and call flow changes
- Operator Connect is presented as a “smarter alternative” with carrier-managed infrastructure, faster deployment, predictable operations, and administration via Teams Admin Center—plus optional enhanced portal capabilities (LoopUp).
- Direct Routing can still be appropriate for specialized interoperability needs (PBX/analog/contact center) and may coexist with Operator Connect.
- Global considerations: regional conferencing numbers, licensing for different device/user types, certificate trust updates, local telco regulations, and countries where Operator Connect is not available.
- A high-level migration roadmap from Direct Routing to Operator Connect (readiness → numbers/addresses → policies/compliance → pilot/scale → BAU).
- An evaluation matrix compares the four models across coverage, cost predictability, compliance, interoperability, operational complexity, scalability, and ideal use cases.

### CTA direction (as currently implied)

No explicit CTA is included. The direction is to encourage readers to evaluate Operator Connect and select a certified provider; LoopUp is referenced as providing enhanced portal capabilities that complement the Teams Admin Center.

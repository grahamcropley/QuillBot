Global voice rarely fails because of one big decision. It usually fails in the day to day: a change request stuck in a queue, a local carrier portal no one can access, and no consistent view of what is live where.

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking is still a core building block for many enterprises, whether you are keeping some legacy PBXs (private branch exchanges), modernising site by site, or moving more calling into Microsoft Teams Phone over time.

That is why we have built new self-service SIP trunk provisioning and management tools in LoopUp One, our global manageme STABLE_SAVE SAVE_TESTnt portal.

The intent is simple. Give enterprise IT and UC teams a single place to manage telephony globally, with role and location based access, and the ability to move faster without losing control.

Self-service is not a goal in itself. It changes the trade-offs. You can reduce handoffs and delays, but you still need governance, visibility, and a clear operational model across regions.

If you are running telephony across multiple geographies, I would be interested to hear what you are optimising for this year: speed of change, consistency and control, or a path off legacy infrastructure without taking unnecessary risk?

Create a blog article of approximately 500 words celebrating LoopUp's Microsoft Teams MVP, Zach Bennett.

The article should:

- Recognize Zach's achievements and explain, in plain language, what a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award represents.
- Position the story for enterprise IT, unified communications (UC), and digital transformation decision-makers who run Microsoft Teams at scale.
- Connect Zach's community contribution to practical outcomes for global Microsoft Teams Phone programs.
- Include factual details that can be verified publicly, such as:
  - Zach is a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp.
  - He has extensive experience in Microsoft UC and voice, including Microsoft Teams Phone.
  - He supports organisations moving from legacy private branch exchange (PBX) telephony to Microsoft Teams Phone.
  - He contributes through public technical content and speaking engagements.

The narrative should keep the focus on why this matters for large, multinational environments, including the operational realities and trade-offs of global voice transformation.

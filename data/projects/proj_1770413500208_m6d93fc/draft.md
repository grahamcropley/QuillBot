# Celebrating LoopUp's Microsoft Teams MVP, Zach Bennett

Enterprise voice tends to be the part of collaboration that exposes every compromise. You can roll out chat and meetings quickly, but telephony forces you to deal with geography, regulation, legacy contracts, and user expectations that have been shaped by decades of "it just works".

That is why we are proud to celebrate Zach Bennett, our Microsoft Teams Most Valuable Professional (MVP). Microsoft awards MVP status to a small group of individuals who share deep technical expertise with the community and help others succeed through teaching, content, and real-world guidance.

## Why an MVP matters to global Teams programs

For enterprise IT teams, Microsoft Teams Phone is rarely a simple switch. It is a program. The moment you introduce the public switched telephone network (PSTN), you inherit questions about number ranges, emergency services, lawful intercept, carrier change processes, and how the experience stays consistent across regions.

An MVP does not just know the product. They live in the gap between Microsoft documentation and the messy reality of a multinational rollout. Zach's recognition is a signal that his day-to-day work, and the lessons he shares publicly, stand up to scrutiny from practitioners who do this for a living.

## Zach's impact at LoopUp

Zach is a Principal Architect at LoopUp, with over a decade in Microsoft unified communications (UC) and voice. He leads Microsoft Teams Phone deployments from strategy and proof of concept through multi-site delivery, supporting organisations as they move away from legacy private branch exchange (PBX) estates.

What that looks like in practice is not just design diagrams. It is helping teams choose the right connectivity model, Operator Connect or Direct Routing, and understanding where each fits. It is balancing standardisation with local requirements, building governance that does not slow delivery, and making sure call quality and security are engineered in from the start.

## Community contribution that stays practical

Zach's MVP recognition is rooted in how he shows up for the wider community. He writes and produces technical guidance, speaks at industry events, and shares patterns that help other teams avoid costly mistakes. In a recent interview, Zach described his interest in voice technologies and his motivation to teach, not just to solve the immediate problem in front of him, but to improve how others approach the same challenges.

That mindset matters because Teams Phone is not a one-time migration. Enterprises need a voice strategy that can evolve with business change, mergers, and shifting operating models.

## A well-earned congratulations

Zach's achievement is worth celebrating on its own. It also reflects something we value at LoopUp: expertise that is earned in the field, tested in the community, and focused on outcomes.

Congratulations, Zach, and thank you for raising the bar for how we help customers modernise voice on Microsoft Teams.

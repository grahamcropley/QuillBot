# Introducing LoopUp One APIs for cloud telephony integration

For enterprise IT and communications leaders, telephony operations often present a tangle of manual tasks, legacy workflows, and integration headaches. As cloud telephony becomes central to business enablement, particularly for global Microsoft Teams Phone deployments, the challenge moves beyond basic connectivity. The real value lies in automation, integration, and a practical bridge between business systems and voice infrastructure.

At LoopUp, we see first-hand how much progress organizations can make when processes are streamlined. Managing numbers globally and provisioning users or sites doesn’t have to be a roadblock. It can be an opportunity for greater efficiency and reliability. That’s why we’re excited to introduce the LoopUp One APIs. They help you automate and tailor your global telephony setup with far greater precision and ease.

## What Are LoopUp One APIs?

LoopUp One APIs open up new possibilities for enterprises to take charge of their cloud telephony environment. With secure, standards-based interfaces, your teams can integrate LoopUp’s cloud telephony capabilities into your unique workflows and business systems. Whether you’re building automation with our Power Automate Custom Connector or developing your own solutions via REST API, these APIs give you the flexibility to centralize operations, eliminate repetitive tasks, and adapt confidently as your needs evolve. All with robust security and control.

## How It Works

Whether you are a technical admin or business operator, the real wins come from connecting telephony tasks to the workflows you already run. Think joiner-mover-leaver processes, service desk requests, and governance checks that need accurate data and consistent execution.

If you use Microsoft Power Automate, you can import the LoopUp API Connector and begin building flows that handle tasks such as:

- Using profile and customer account data to drive the right routing, approvals, and customer context in your automation
- Provisioning or deprovisioning Direct Dial-In (DDI) numbers as part of onboarding and offboarding for Microsoft Teams Phone users
- Maintaining an up-to-date view of number inventory by site, country, city, and allocation status, so planning and audits are based on current data
- Creating and updating sites to support emergency calling compliance and keep location information current as offices change

For organizations that need direct, programmatic access, the REST API endpoints provide the flexibility to integrate LoopUp telephony capabilities into custom applications, IT service management platforms, or internal dashboards. Authentication follows a standard pattern: use the Power Automate connection, or for direct API access, obtain a LoopUp Identity client ID and secret from your account manager.

## What’s Available Now

These capabilities are currently in private preview. Actions and endpoints continue to evolve as we work with early adopters, but the foundational set includes profile lookups, customer details, number assignment, listing DDI numbers, and site management. All endpoints prioritize security, minimising risk when connecting and automating sensitive workflows.

## What’s the Impact?

The introduction of LoopUp One APIs represents a shift towards automation and integration-first thinking for cloud telephony. For teams managing call flows, user provisioning, or compliance across multiple regions, these APIs mean fewer bottlenecks, better data accuracy, and a foundation ready for future needs. Instead of waiting for portal updates or resorting to manual fixes, operations teams can focus on strategy and business value.

## Looking Ahead

We’re excited to see how organizations will use LoopUp One APIs to streamline global voice operations. If you’re interested in joining the private preview or want to learn how these APIs could support your unified communications strategy, reach out to your account manager. The road ahead promises a simpler, more integrated future for enterprise voice.

# The hidden friction in global Teams Phone rollouts

## Teams Phone is not the hard part

Most multinational organisations do not struggle with Microsoft Teams Phone as an app. They struggle with telephony as an operating model.

## PSTN is where complexity lives

When you roll Teams Phone out globally, you quickly run into PSTN, the public switched telephone network that still carries calls to and from the wider world. That is where the real complexity sits. Country by country, you are pulled into local carrier relationships, local numbers, local regulations, and local support models. The result is rarely a single design, it is a collection of regional exceptions.

## How fragmentation happens

If you have lived through the traditional approach, it will feel familiar. Local PBXs here, a SIP trunk there, a carrier contract per region, and a spreadsheet that tries to keep track of it all. Each market has its own pricing structures, contract terms, lead times, porting processes, and change windows. Even when you standardise on Teams Phone, your telephony layer stays fragmented.

## The operational cost of a patchwork

That fragmentation shows up in practical ways.

Onboarding a new country becomes a project, not a task. Moves, adds, and changes are slowed down by handoffs between suppliers. Incident response is uneven because each carrier has its own tooling, escalation routes, and service levels. Finance teams fight invoice formats and currency issues, while procurement tries to reconcile renewals and terms across a patchwork of agreements. Meanwhile, IT leaders carry the risk of inconsistent governance, with different dial plans, policies, and controls depending on where the user sits.

## LoopUp reduces carrier fragmentation

LoopUp tackles the problem at the point where it starts, the carrier layer.

Rather than treating PSTN as an afterthought to a Teams deployment, LoopUp provides global cloud telephony for Teams Phone with a single provider model. In practice that means you connect Teams Phone to LoopUp via Operator Connect and or Direct Routing, and you run telephony in a more consistent way across geographies.

That consistency shows up in the places global teams feel pain.

You get one onboarding approach instead of different carrier runbooks by country. Number orders, porting, and site turn-ups follow a familiar path, which reduces the rework that often creeps into multi-region programmes.

You get one support model instead of juggling regional escalation routes. When something breaks, the goal is to resolve the incident, not to work out which supplier owns the fault and how to reach them.

You get one commercial relationship instead of a portfolio of contracts. Procurement and finance spend less time managing renewals, terms, invoice formats, and regional price anomalies.

## What changes with a single provider

The biggest shift is operational.

With one telco provider, you simplify ownership and accountability. You reduce the number of contracts, renewal dates, and commercial models you have to manage. You move away from region-by-region design decisions and towards a repeatable rollout playbook, which is the only way global deployments stay predictable.

It also changes how fast you can move.

When onboarding is standardised, you spend less time re-learning the same processes in each market. When service levels and support routes are consistent, you reduce time lost in escalations and carrier finger-pointing. When number management and change processes are aligned, you can make policy and configuration changes without re-planning the entire programme.

None of this removes the realities of national telephony, but it does put them behind a single operating model. For enterprise teams trying to make Teams Phone a true global standard, that is often the difference between a rollout that stalls in regional complexity, and one that keeps its momentum.

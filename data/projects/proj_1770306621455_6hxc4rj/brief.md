## Brief

Write a ~500-word blog article for enterprise IT and UC decision-makers.

Topic: the historical fragmentation of global enterprise telephony, where multinational rollouts required local PBXs and local carriers in each country, leading to a patchwork of suppliers, contracts, terms, pricing, and operational processes.

Angle: frame the story around Microsoft Teams Phone global PSTN rollout. Explain why PSTN (public switched telephone network) access is the hard part at scale, and why organisations end up with uneven capabilities and governance across regions.

LoopUp message: show how LoopUp reduces fragmentation by acting as a single global telco provider for Teams Phone via Operator Connect and or Direct Routing, providing consistent coverage, governance, and operational model.

Benefits to highlight (business and operational): fewer suppliers and contracts to manage, simpler commercial model, consistent service levels, faster onboarding across geographies, reduced change and incident management complexity, clearer ownership, and better long-term control.

Constraints: use exact Microsoft terminology (Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony, Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans). Define PSTN on first use. No hype or hard sell.

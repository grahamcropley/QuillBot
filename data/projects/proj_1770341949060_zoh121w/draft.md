# Celebrating Zach Bennett, Microsoft Teams MVP 🎉

Enterprise collaboration lives or dies on execution. The strategy can be sound, but day-to-day realities like user adoption, governance, and telephony choices decide whether Microsoft Teams delivers.

That is why we are proud to celebrate Zach Bennett, LoopUp’s Microsoft Teams MVP 👏

Zach consistently shows up for the Teams community, sharing practical guidance that helps enterprise IT teams make confident decisions, especially when the stakes are high and users are spread across regions 🌍

His contribution is not just technical. He helps teams translate business requirements into workable approaches for Microsoft Teams Phone, Operator Connect, and Direct Routing, including how to think about PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) connectivity, operational ownership, and ongoing change.

We see the impact in the questions he helps people answer 💬

What is the right model for our geography and risk appetite?
How do we keep voice reliable while we modernise?
How do we set standards that scale without slowing teams down?

Zach’s MVP recognition reflects that mix of expertise and generosity. We are lucky to have him as a colleague, and our customers benefit from the same clear, pragmatic thinking.

Congrats, Zach. Well deserved 🙌

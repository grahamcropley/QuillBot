title: "Teams Queues App: Your Calls, But Make It Hot"
---

If your support line currently feels like a group chat where everyone’s typing “who’s got this?” while the customer slowly turns into a fossil… hi. Microsoft Teams’ **Queues app** is here to make call queues feel less like a haunted house and more like a well-lit kitchen where everyone knows where the snacks are.

At a high level, the Queues app is a **Teams-native** place for handling customer calls (powered by Teams Phone) without bouncing between tools like a caffeinated pinball. Agents get a clean workspace to answer and place calls; leads get the “I’m watching you, but lovingly” controls; admins get less ticket-driven chaos. Everybody wins. Nobody has to open _yet another_ tab. (Your browser can finally unclench.)

## Agents: the “I can handle this” era

First, the basics—**incoming calls**. The Queues app supports handling incoming calls whether they’re **PSTN or VoIP**. That means when the phone rings, you don’t have to go spelunking through Teams to find the right place to answer. It’s right there, like your favorite person at the party.

Then there’s the big relationship status upgrade: **Opt in / Opt out** of queues. You can join the queue when you’re ready to be perceived and dip out when you’re about to combust. And if your org uses **presence-based routing**, you’ll only get calls when you’re _both_ opted in _and_ set to **Available**. Translation: no more getting queue calls while you’re “Busy” because you’re eating lunch with the intensity of a courtroom drama.

Need to call customers back, but don’t want to dox your personal number? The Queues app lets you **make outbound calls on behalf of the call queue or auto attendant** you’re assigned to—so the customer sees your org, not “Mysterious Cell Number (Probably a Scam).” Professional. Branded. Slightly seductive.

And because we all love receipts: you can **view call history** (including missed calls with voicemail) and return calls with the queue-associated number. Flaky follow-up? Not in this economy.

## Leads: coaching without the “micromanage-y” aftertaste

Leads get the real fun toys—aka, the stuff that makes your team better _without_ turning into a spreadsheet goblin.

You can **monitor queues and people in real time**, opt agents in/out as needed, and (with the right policy + licensing) use the iconic quartet:

- **Monitor**: listen in quietly.
- **Whisper**: coach the agent without the caller hearing (the professional version of “pssst, say the thing”).
- **Barge**: jump in and talk to both sides.
- **Takeover**: gently remove the agent from the call and handle it yourself.

It’s like being a call center ninja… but with better UI.

## Analytics: because vibes are not a KPI

The Queues app includes **real-time stats**—think calls waiting, average wait time, and other “are we okay?” signals—plus **historical reporting** (typically up to the last ~27 days) and the ability to **export to Excel** for the folks who experience joy only when a pivot table snaps into place.

## The spicy new-new: Shared call history (rolling out)

The upcoming headline feature: **shared call history** for queue members—so the team can see missed, incoming, and outgoing call events in one shared view. It’s rolling out **January–February 2026**, and it’s **disabled by default**, meaning your admin has to enable it. (Yes, you still have to flirt with the Teams Admin Center a little.)

## Tiny but important fine print (aka: consent and licensing)

Queues app is available when users have **Teams Phone + Teams Premium**. Some lead features (like Monitor/Whisper/Barge/Takeover) also depend on **voice applications policy** settings. Platform-wise, it’s primarily for **desktop/Mac/VDI**, and it’s also supported on **Teams phones (touch devices)**.

Bottom line: the Queues app takes call queues out of the “everyone panic separately” era and into the “we’re coordinated and slightly smug about it” era. Your customers get faster help. Your agents get calmer days. Your leads get actual levers to pull. And your team gets to keep everything inside Teams—where, frankly, we already live.

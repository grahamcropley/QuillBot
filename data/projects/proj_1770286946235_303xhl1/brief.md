# New features of Queues App in Teams

**Type**: blog
**Word Count**: 500

## Brief

Write a ~500-word blog post highlighting _new / notable_ features and capabilities of the **Queues app in Microsoft Teams** (Teams Phone).

The post should:

### 1) Explain what the Queues app is (plain-English, 1 short paragraph)

- Describe it as a **Teams-native workspace** for handling **Teams Phone call queues and auto attendants**.
- Make it clear it’s for people doing day-to-day call handling (agents) and queue oversight (leads), **inside Teams**.
- Keep it concrete: “a dedicated place in Teams to opt into a queue, take calls, place outbound calls on behalf of the queue, and see queue performance.”

### 2) Highlight key capabilities (use the checklist; pick the most exciting ones)

- Cover **both personas**:
  - **Agents/members**: opt in/out, take incoming calls (PSTN/VoIP), outbound calls on behalf of queue/AA, call history, real-time stats.
  - **Leads/supervisors**: real-time monitoring/oversight, coaching/escalation controls (Monitor/Whisper/Barge/Takeover), reporting (real-time + historical) and Excel export.
- Don’t try to name every admin setting; focus on **what it enables in the app**.
- Include at least **one “what’s new / noteworthy right now”** item (e.g., shared call history rollout).

### 3) Mention licensing/prereqs (1–2 sentences, not a licensing guide)

- Keep it high-level and non-scary, e.g.:
  - “Queues app is available with **Teams Phone + Teams Premium**.”
  - “Some supervisor features also depend on your admin enabling the right policies/settings.”
- Optional: a quick platform note if it fits naturally (desktop/Mac/VDI + Teams phones touch).

### 4) Tone requirements (how it should _feel_ when reading)

- **Jokes throughout**: at least one joke or playful line every 2–3 paragraphs.
- **Casual voice**: contractions, conversational asides, light slang OK.
- **Lightly spicy (PG-13)**: flirty metaphors and “spicy” phrasing are fine, but:
  - No explicit sexual content, no graphic language.
  - No harassment, no objectifying real people.
  - Keep it workplace-safe: think “cheeky sitcom,” not “late-night cable.”
- **Not serious** doesn’t mean inaccurate: keep claims aligned to the sources.

Avoid:

- Inventing features not supported by sources.
- Confusing generic Teams Call Queues admin features with the **Queues app** experience.

## Style Hints

jokes all the time, not serious, causal, a bit sexy and spicy

## Feature checklist (grounded)

Agent/member flow:

- Handle incoming PSTN or VoIP calls in Teams.
- Opt in / opt out of queues; presence-based routing note (must be Available + opted in when enabled).
- Make outbound calls on behalf of assigned call queues / auto attendants (brand/privacy).
- View call history (personal history; voicemail-missed calls included) and call back.
- View real-time queue stats/analytics dashboards (waiting calls, average wait, longest wait, abandoned calls, etc; metrics depend on admin settings).

Lead/supervisor flow:

- Manage queue members (opt agents in/out) and monitor queues/auto attendants.
- Monitor/Whisper/Barge/Takeover for coaching/escalation (requires Teams Premium + voice applications policy).
- Real-time + historical reporting (historical limited to ~27 days) with Excel export.

Admin/rollout notes:

- Licensing: Teams Phone + Teams Premium.
- Platform support: desktop/Mac/VDI; Teams phones (touch devices) supported; web not supported per Learn doc.
- **Shared call history** for queue members is rolling out Jan–Feb 2026; disabled by default; admin enablement required; no tenant migration initially.

## Working title

One number plan, one provider, less operational drag

## Outline

### 1. The hidden tax of global telephony

- Growth, M&A, and new sites create voice sprawl
- Telephony touches finance, security, user experience, and business continuity

### 2. How we got here

- Local PBXs, local carrier relationships, and country rules
- Each market brings its own contracts, SLAs, pricing, and support paths

### 3. What fragmentation looks like in practice

- Change management across suppliers
- Inconsistent numbers and porting journeys
- Reporting gaps and billing reconciliation
- Varied resilience and incident handling

### 4. Microsoft Teams Phone changes the user experience, not always the operating model

- Teams standardises the client
- PSTN still matters, define it and explain why it becomes the complex part

### 5. A single global provider model

- Operator Connect as the operating model simplifier
- One commercial relationship, one support model, one set of processes

### 6. Tangible benefits IT and the business feel

- Faster rollout and change
- Fewer contracts, clearer governance
- More predictable costs and fewer billing surprises
- Consistent user experience across geographies
- Better operational visibility and escalation

### 7. Trade-offs and what to look for

- Coverage vs consistency
- What standardisation means, and where local exceptions remain
- Questions to ask suppliers

### 8. Closing

- Reframe success as reducing operational drag while keeping voice reliable

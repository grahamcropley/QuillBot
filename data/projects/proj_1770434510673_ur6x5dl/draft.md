# One global carrier for Teams Phone

If you Microsoft Teams across multiple regions, you probably want Teams Phone to be just as consistent. In reality, global telephony rarely looks like a single system. It looks like a patchwork of regional carriers, uneven contracts, different tariffs, and too many admin tools. When something breaks, you are also coordinating multiple support teams, across multiple time zones.

We see a second problem when organisations try to solve this with Direct Routing alone. The market is crowded, and not every provider has the engineering discipline, regulatory coverage, or support maturity you need at enterprise scale. Telephony is unforgiving. A small quality issue becomes a daily productivity tax.

LoopUp exists to remove that fragmentation. We help multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage Teams Phone, globally, with one provider.

## What Operator Connect changes
 
Operator Connect is Microsoft's program that allows certified operators to connect PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services directly into Microsoft Teams Phone. It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.

LoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.

## How LoopUp works in the real world

Global Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.

We bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.

For many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.

## Why enterprises choose LoopUp

You can measure this in operational terms:

- One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.
- One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.
- One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.
- One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.

Then there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing. That is how you drive consistent voice quality across regions, instead of leaving it to chance.

## The trade-offs to plan for

Telecommunications is regulated, and not every country allows the same level of PSTN replacement. A serious global program expects this. The practical choice is usually not Operator Connect or Direct Routing. It is choosing where each model makes sense, and keeping operations consistent.

| What you are deciding             | Operator Connect                                                                                 | Direct Routing                                                                                               | LoopUp approach                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Who manages the SBC layer         | Your operator manages the SBCs as part of the service (per Microsoft Operator Connect guidance). | You provide and manage a supported SBC that connects to Teams Phone (per Microsoft Direct Routing guidance). | We run Operator Connect where available, and provide Direct Routing as a service where needed, without you running SBCs on premises. |
| How numbers are assigned          | You connect to the operator and assign numbers in the Teams admin center.                        | Numbers and routing are managed through your SBC and voice routing design.                                   | One service model across countries, with central management in LoopUp One and the right Teams configuration for each region.         |
| Deployment and day two operations | Faster initial deployment when your operator participates, with operator-managed infrastructure. | More design flexibility, but more infrastructure and operational ownership.                                  | One vendor, one rollout plan, and consistent operations across the mix.                                                              |
| Support boundaries                | Operator provides support and can escalate to Microsoft through shared channels.                 | Microsoft support is bounded, issues typically start with your SBC vendor and your voice team.               | One support process globally, with clear ownership across Operator Connect and Direct Routing.                                       |
| Where each tends to fit           | Great when Operator Connect coverage matches your footprint and you want simplicity.             | Useful for specialist integrations and locations where Operator Connect is not the right option.             | Designed for multinationals that want consolidation, and still need breadth across regulated markets.                                |

## Your next step

Stop running Teams telephony country by country. Check coverage for your key countries, then we can map the right deployment approach and consolidate your global telephony with one partner, one portal, and one support process.

## Interpretation of Client Brief: LoopUp Cloud Telephony Services Blog (500 words)

- **Objective:** Write a blog article (approx. 500 words) for LoopUp’s Marketing team, aimed at enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation leaders managing global operations.

- **Content Focus:** Provide an expert, business-first overview of LoopUp’s Cloud Telephony services. Frame the discussion around operational impact, trade-offs, and long-term implications, not just features. Begin with business context, progress through definitions (with clear explanation of acronyms like PSTN, UC, etc.), describe how LoopUp Cloud Telephony works, highlight trade-offs, and conclude with a resolution.

- **Voice & Tone:** Authoritative yet warm; guidance-first. Recognize reader friction before proposing solutions. Use concrete examples, vary sentence rhythm, and avoid monotone. First-person perspective permitted for authenticity.

- **Structure:** Logical flow from context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary. Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences. No hard sell at the end.

- **Terminology:** Strictly use approved terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony, Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans. Define acronyms (e.g., PSTN) at first mention. Avoid synonym-swapping.

- **Avoid:** Em-dashes, colon-split headings, semicolon overuse, filler phrases, buzzwords, one-shot responses.

- **Success Criteria:** Feels like genuine expert guidance, not generic or robotic. Satisfies hard rules and format requirements. Ready for feedback and ongoing iteration.

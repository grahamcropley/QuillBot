## Audience

Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers in multi-national organisations.

## Core Message

Global telephony has historically been fragmented, with local PBXs and local carriers in each country. That patchwork creates real operational drag for multi-national companies. LoopUp reduces that complexity by acting as a single global cloud telephony provider for Microsoft Teams Phone, with consistent service delivery across geographies.

## What To Cover

- The real-world pain of fragmentation: multiple carriers and PBXs, inconsistent contracts, pricing, support, compliance, and change processes.
- Why this becomes an IT operating model problem, not just a telephony problem.
- How LoopUp approaches global PSTN delivery for Teams Phone.
- Tangible benefits of one provider: fewer contracts, simpler governance, predictable commercials, faster change, consistent support model, clearer ownership, easier reporting.

## Tone

Business-first and pragmatic. Recognition before solution. No hard sell, end with a calm resolution.

Not all MVPs are created equal. Zach Bennett isn’t just your average Microsoft Teams fan—he’s the office legend whose Teams expertise and meme magic keep our digital workplace running with more laughs than groans.

## Why Zach Rocks the Teams Block

- Sees a grid of groggy 9am faces and finds ways to connect, collaborate, and entertain
- Drops perfectly-timed GIFs and memes into every Teams chat
- Knows every Teams shortcut, emoji, and trick (if Teams made clones, they’d all be called Zach 2.0)
- Turns "Can everyone see my screen?" into an event, not a problem
- May or may not be powered by endless WiFi and Office 365 wizardry

## Sarcasm: The Secret Ingredient

- Humblebrags about Teams skills with charm
- Turns “You’re still on mute!” from frustration to beloved running joke
- Keeps us awake through meetings with sharp quips and gentle roasting
- Isn’t just the glue—he’s the duct tape, the sticker, and sometimes, the caffeinated hype man

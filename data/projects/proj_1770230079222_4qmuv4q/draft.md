# Celebrating Zach Bennett: Our Very Own Microsoft Teams MVP

We're absolutely thrilled to shine a spotlight on someone who's been making serious waves in the Microsoft Teams community — our Principal Architect, Zach Bennett.

Zach has just been renewed as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Microsoft Teams — and let's be clear about what that means. Out of the millions of IT professionals working with Microsoft technologies across the United Kingdom, only 18 hold this title for Teams. Eighteen. Microsoft hand-picks these people because they're not just good at what they do — they're among the absolute best in the world, actively shaping the future of how enterprises communicate. Zach is one of them.

## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion

Zach's journey is one of those brilliant "follow your passion" stories. He studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during his placement year at General Electric, he had a realisation that would shape his career: the big corporate life wasn't for him. He wanted somewhere more intimate, where he could wear many hats and really make an impact.

That Computer Science foundation matters. It’s the kind of degree that forces you to think in systems: how complex parts connect, where failures actually come from, and how to troubleshoot methodically when the obvious answer isn’t the right one. Pair that with a real industry placement inside a huge organisation, and you get an engineer who can speak both languages — the technical detail _and_ the messy reality of how big enterprises operate.

It also explains a lot about Zach today: he’s not just “good with Teams.” He’s good at the underlying problem—designing, debugging, and scaling real-world communications systems that have to work for thousands of people, across multiple countries, under real constraints.

He started out managing Cisco phone systems, but quickly found his true calling in the Microsoft ecosystem — first with development work, then Skype for Business, and eventually discovering his passion in voice deployments. As he puts it: "The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate… What's next?" That forward-thinking mindset has driven everything since.

## What Zach Actually Does (It's a Lot)

As Principal Architect at LoopUp, Zach sits at the heart of our most complex global telephony deployments. This isn't just "set up some phones" work — it's enterprise-scale transformation for multinational organisations operating across 100+ countries.

Day to day, Zach leads the full journey: strategic planning, proof-of-concept design, and multi-site rollouts that can span dozens of countries simultaneously. He works directly with global enterprises to migrate them away from fragmented legacy PBX systems — often a patchwork of regional carriers, each with their own contracts, billing, support teams, and headaches — onto a unified Microsoft Teams Phone platform.

He advises on Microsoft licensing optimisation, security configurations, and modern workplace capabilities, ensuring clients don't just get Teams Phone working, but get the absolute maximum value from it. Whether it's navigating the complexities of Operator Connect, architecting Direct Routing solutions via our Cloud Telephony Platform, or helping organisations tackle tricky markets like China and India, Zach's the one making it happen.

In short: when a Fortune 500 company needs to consolidate their global voice infrastructure and actually make it work seamlessly, Zach's the architect they turn to.

## Building for the Community

What really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.

His blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to Voice Isolation features, the new Queues App capabilities, and the latest Direct Routing troubleshooting tools rolling out in Teams Admin Center.

His YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more. And then there's **teamstts.com** — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live, using the same voices Microsoft Teams uses on the backend. If you've ever had a company name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.

## On Stage and Around the World

Zach's passion for teaching extends well beyond the screen. One of his most memorable career moments came at Comms vNext 2024 in Denver, Colorado — his first major international speaking engagement — where he presented "Is Teams Ready To Be Your Contact Center?" to an audience of Microsoft communications professionals from around the globe.

Since then, he's become a regular on the conference circuit. Just last November, he was at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, co-presenting "Unlock MS Teams Phone Globally: Insights from World's Leading Brands" with our own Andrew Birch. He's a fixture at Commsverse (the UK's premier Microsoft Teams conference) and is already confirmed to speak at Commsverse 2026.

He's also been featured across industry publications — Authority Magazine, AI TechPark, NODE Magazine — sharing his insights on the future of enterprise communications and AI-driven telephony.

## The Person Behind the Professional

Here's something you might not know about Zach: his favourite quote is "The Dude abides" from The Big Lebowski. As he explains it, it's about accepting life's challenges, taking things in your stride, and remembering what truly matters. Pretty solid life philosophy, if you ask us.

He's also quick to credit others for his success — particularly Graham Cropley, our Head of Global Consulting, who Zach describes as a constant source of knowledge and encouragement throughout his career. And on the personal front, 2025 has been extra special: Zach recently welcomed a baby girl into the world.

## What's Next?

With Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — AI-powered features, Copilot integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge, both for our clients and for the wider community.

So here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, new dad, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast. Congratulations on another well-deserved year of recognition!

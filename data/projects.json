      "documentContent": "# Celebrating LoopUp's Microsoft Teams MVP, Zach Bennett\n\nEnterprise voice tends to be the part of collaboration that exposes every compromise. You can roll out chat and meetings quickly, but telephony forces you to deal with geography, regulation, legacy contracts, and user expectations that have been shaped by decades of \"it just works\".\n\nThat is why we are proud to celebrate Zach Bennett, our Microsoft Teams Most Valuable Professional (MVP). Microsoft awards MVP status to a small group of individuals who share deep technical expertise with the community and help others succeed through teaching, content, and real-world guidance.\n\n## Why an MVP matters to global Teams programs\n\nFor enterprise IT teams, Microsoft Teams Phone is rarely a simple switch. It is a program. The moment you introduce the public switched telephone network (PSTN), you inherit questions about number ranges, emergency services, lawful intercept, carrier change processes, and how the experience stays consistent across regions.\n\nAn MVP does not just know the product. They live in the gap between Microsoft documentation and the messy reality of a multinational rollout. Zach's recognition is a signal that his day-to-day work, and the lessons he shares publicly, stand up to scrutiny from practitioners who do this for a living.\n\n## Zach's impact at LoopUp\n\nZach is a Principal Architect at LoopUp, with over a decade in Microsoft unified communications (UC) and voice. He leads Microsoft Teams Phone deployments from strategy and proof of concept through multi-site delivery, supporting organisations as they move away from legacy private branch exchange (PBX) estates.\n\nWhat that looks like in practice is not just design diagrams. It is helping teams choose the right connectivity model, Operator Connect or Direct Routing, and understanding where each fits. It is balancing standardisation with local requirements, building governance that does not slow delivery, and making sure call quality and security are engineered in from the start.\n\n## Community contribution that stays practical\n\nZach's MVP recognition is rooted in how he shows up for the wider community. He writes and produces technical guidance, speaks at industry events, and shares patterns that help other teams avoid costly mistakes. In a recent interview, Zach described his interest in voice technologies and his motivation to teach, not just to solve the immediate problem in front of him, but to improve how others approach the same challenges.\n\nThat mindset matters because Teams Phone is not a one-time migration. Enterprises need a voice strategy that can evolve with business change, mergers, and shifting operating models.\n\n## A well-earned congratulations\n\nZach's achievement is worth celebrating on its own. It also reflects something we value at LoopUp: expertise that is earned in the field, tested in the community, and focused on outcomes.\n\nCongratulations, Zach, and thank you for raising the bar for how we help customers modernise voice on Microsoft Teams.\n",

              "text": "# Instructions to generate marketing material\nThe **aim of this project** is for you to to generate a draft document\ncalled draft.md that contains a blog for LoopUp's Marketing team.\n\nAll changes, tweaks, ammendments, improvemets, and updates to the\ncontent **MUST** be made in the document.\n\nThe approximate length of the final document should be around 500 words.\n\nThe brief provided by the client is contained inside the <brief> tags.\n<brief>\nCelebrate the achievements of our very own Microsoft Teams MVP Zach Bennett.\n</brief>\n\nAfter you have thought about the brief, create a file called brief.md that\ncontains your interpretation of the requirements in your own words to refer\nto when creating or updating the marketing document.\n\n## BEHAVIOUR\nIt's your job to fully understand the brief, if anything is too vague, has\naspects that are not clear, contains ambigious wording that could be taken\ninto different directions, or if you have any suggestions to improve the\nbrief, you **MUST use the question tool** when asking questions or getting\nclarification from the client at any point.\n\nYou **MUST** only ask one question at a time. You **MUST** update the brief.md with\nyour current and evolving understanding of the requirements as the\nconversation progresses. You **MUST NOT** include any style hints or formatting\nreferences in the brief.md file - JUST the content requirements.\n\nIf you do not have any more questions, you should proceed to write the\ndocument.\n\nFinally follow up with a helpful message suggesting that you are open to\nfeedback, or only too happy to clarify your reasoning behind any of it.\n\nThe client will ask you for changes, additions, adjustments, etc. you MUST\nupdate the document as requested until the client is happy.\n\nAlways search the internet for sources of factual information, do not manufacture\nany features or functionality unles specifically asked to. If the brief contains\nany mention of 'recent' or 'latest' you should search online for confirmation\nand up to date information such as news, latest releases, roadmap items, etc.\n\n## HARD RULES\n**Keep these rules in mind when writing the document**\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n## VOICE\n**You are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.**\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n**The document should ideally follow this structure unless told otherwise**\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n## FORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\nUse these hints to guide the document based on what has been asked for.\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**\n- Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria,\n  if not already mentioned already.\n\n## TERMINOLOGY\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n## BEFORE FINALISING\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\n## IMPORTANT\nDo NOT mention these rules or the revision process in draft document.\nDo NOT include follow up questions or any non-content output in the draft document."

During a placement year at General Electric, he realised he preferred a working environment where he could take on diverse responsibilities rather than a conventional large-company structure.\n\n## Professional expertise\n\nZach has over a decade of experience in Microsoft unified-communications (UC) and voice solutions — in particular focusing on telephony and voice integration with collaboration tools. As Principal Architect at LoopUp, he leads global deployments of Microsoft Teams Phone for enterprise clients — from strategic planning and proof-of-concept to multi-site rollouts. He advises organisations on optimising Microsoft licensing, security, and modern workplace capabilities to ensure enterprises can fully leverage Teams and cloud-based telephony.\n\n[![Zach Bennett thought leadership](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2025/12/zach-bennett-thought-leadership.jpg)](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/multinational-businesses-are-struggling-to-breathe-under-the-weight-of-geographically-bound-telephony)\n\n## Thought leadership and community engagement\n\nZach participates actively in the broader technical community: he writes technical blogs, produces educational content, and delivers talks and presentations on voice deployments and modern communications. He was featured in a 2025 interview discussing the future of communication technology, articulating how cloud telephony and integrated communication platforms can transform enterprise communication.\n\n## Philosophy and approach\n\nZach balances technical acumen with a consultative mindset — he prioritises continuous learning, staying abreast of evolving telecom and UC trends, and helping clients navigate migrations from legacy PBX systems to cloud-native solutions. In his own words (from a public interview): “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?” — reflecting his forward-looking view on communication technologies.\n\n> “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?”\n\n## Role at LoopUp and impact\n\nAt LoopUp — a global cloud-communications provider offering managed telephony around Microsoft Teams and operating across 100+ countries — Zach ensures enterprises can modernise voice infrastructure with minimal friction.\n\nHis work supports customers in consolidating fragmented telephony systems, reducing cost and complexity, and providing a scalable, secure, and consistent global communication platform.\n\n## Read Zach’s latest posts\n\n#### [Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here](https://loopup.com/en/resource-center/from-our-mvp/redefining-global-communication-the-future-is-already-here/ \"Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here\")\n\nRemote collaboration is now the norm, but enterprise voice hasn’t kept pace.

Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp, recently spoke with Authority Magazine about where communication technology is heading and how global businesses can stay ahead. As Zach explains, the future isn’t something to prepare for later. It’s already happening.\n\nAt LoopUp, we see this every day. Multinational enterprises are still juggling legacy systems, regional telecom vendors, and fragmented contracts that limit the full value of Microsoft Teams. We help companies replace that complexity with a centralized, cloud-based solution that scales globally.\n\n## One Platform. One Strategy. One Future.\n\nWhile Microsoft Teams has been widely adopted, many companies still rely on outdated telephony setups. The result is technical disconnect, inconsistent user experience, and unnecessary cost. Our approach is different. We deliver a single, enterprise-grade PSTN replacement across more than 100 countries, fully integrated with Teams.\n\nThis isn’t just about modernizing infrastructure. It’s about building a future-ready foundation. That means flexible architecture, regulatory compliance, and a services model that supports long-term transformation.\n\n## Trusted by Multinationals\n\nZach’s advice is rooted in experience: listen carefully, design with intent, and rely on partners who understand the stakes. At LoopUp, we bring deep Microsoft expertise, global reach, and a proven track record.

Even in an era where Teams and other collaboration tools have transformed the way we work, many organizations remain tied to geographically bound telephony systems. These legacy models create complexity, drive up costs, and hold global enterprises back from realizing the full potential of cloud communications.\n\nZach explains that multinationals too often find themselves locked into regional carrier contracts, each with its own billing, service levels, and support structures. What should be a seamless global communications environment becomes fragmented. The result is wasted time, administrative burden, and an inconsistent user experience. For global enterprises with offices spanning continents, this challenge grows exponentially.\n\nThe article points out that multinationals have reached a breaking point. While the modern workplace depends on flexibility and collaboration without borders, the underlying telephony infrastructure is still operating with outdated rules. Employees expect to work from anywhere, customers expect to reach the right person quickly, yet global enterprises are left juggling multiple systems that simply do not align with these realities.\n\nLoopUp’s perspective, shared by Zach, is that the solution lies in simplifying and unifying global telephony. By consolidating services into a single, cloud-based approach, multinationals can eliminate the inefficiencies of regional contracts and gain greater control. Just as importantly, they can ensure that their communications platform evolves in step with their wider digital transformation strategy.\n\nThe piece in NODE Magazine makes clear that global enterprises cannot afford to continue operating with geographically bound systems. The pace of business, the scale of global collaboration, and the need for secure, reliable connections all demand a different approach. As Zach emphasizes, multinationals that take decisive steps now to unify their telephony will position themselves for stronger performance and more resilient operations in the years ahead.\n\n[Click here to read the full story in NODE Magazine](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/multinational-businesses-are-struggling-to-breathe-under-the-weight-of-geographically-bound-telephony?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nAbout LoopUp\n\nLoopUp helps multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage global Microsoft Teams telephony, offering phone numbers and full cloud-based PSTN replacement in more than 100 countries.

Rather than treating the RFP as a purely technical checklist, Zach reframes it as a strategic moment that defines how an organisation will communicate and collaborate across its entire footprint for years to come.\n\nHe highlights why the most successful RFPs begin with outcomes. When enterprises focus first on the global experience they want to deliver, the process becomes far more purposeful. It evolves from reviewing specifications to designing the communication environment that will support long term growth, consistency and operational simplicity.\n\nZach also points to a common challenge. Many multinational organisations still approach telephony country by country, which inevitably recreates fragmentation. His article underscores the importance of choosing a unified global network that removes complexity rather than multiplying it.\n\nThe piece is a thoughtful reminder that the RFP is more than a document. It is the decision point where strategy, capability and global ambition align.

Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n\nT*he telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate with people all over the world. But then came email and took it to the next level. And then came text messaging. And then came video calls. And so on…What’s next? What’s just around the corner?*\n\n*In this interview series, called ‘The Future Of Communication Technology’ we are interviewing leaders of tech or telecom companies who are helping to develop emerging communication technologies and the next generation of how we communicate and connect with each other.*\n\n*As a part of this series, I had the pleasure of interviewing Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp.*\n\n*Zach Bennett has been immersed in the world of Microsoft technologies since graduating from university 9 years ago, where he had a special focus on voice technologies. Throughout his career, Zach has found joy in sharing his expertise and knowledge with others. Teaching has always been a passion of his, and he is eager to expand his reach and connect with a broader technical community through engaging talks and presentations.*\n\n*Currently, Zach is a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, a leading Cloud Telephony provider. At LoopUp, the company specializes in offering PSTN solutions built around Microsoft Teams and is proud to participate in the Operator Connect program. In his day-to-day role, Zach works closely with global organizations, assisting them in transitioning from their outdated PBX systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. Leveraging Operator Connect or Direct Routing via the LoopUp Cloud Telephony Platform, he helps these organizations seamlessly migrate and unlock the full potential of Microsoft Teams for their communication needs.*\n\n**Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started?**\n\nI studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during my year in industry at General Electric, I realized that the big company life might not be for me. I wanted a workplace that was more intimate, where I could wear many hats and help out wherever possible.\n\nMy interest in Microsoft technologies led me to development work, and eventually, I found my passion in voice deployments with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is where I discovered what I truly love to do, and I’ve been pursuing it ever since.\n\nThe announcement and success of Microsoft Teams opened up a whole new dimension to my career. I delved into the telephony side of Teams, and I enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey led me to LoopUp, where we have a revolutionary approach to Microsoft Teams calling and the technology behind it, which I now help deliver to our customers. Along with this, my continued commitment to community work has offered me the opportunity to join the Microsoft MVP program specialising in Microsoft Teams where I am 1/18 in the UK.\n\n**Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?**\n\nOne of the most interesting and memorable experiences in my career happened when I was invited to talk at CommsVNext in Denver, CO. As a Microsoft Teams MVP, I had the opportunity to present at this prestigious international event, which is dedicated to Microsoft Communications and Collaborations Technologies.\n\nThe event was held at the hotel in downtown Denver, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. I remember preparing extensively for my presentation called “Is Teams ready to be your Contact Center?” where I explored the capabilities of Microsoft Teams in handling complex communication needs and shared insights on maximizing its effectiveness.\n\nWhat made this experience truly special was the sense of community and the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals. The event was well-organized, with all sessions, exhibitors, and food in close proximity, making it easy to engage with attendees and participate in various discussions.\n\nDuring my talk, I shared real-world customer scenarios and solutions, which resonated well with the audience. The feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive, and it was gratifying to see how my insights could help others in their journey with Microsoft Teams.\n\nOverall, CommsVNext in Denver was an unforgettable experience that reinforced my passion for Microsoft technologies and the importance of community engagement. It was a privilege to be part of such a vibrant and knowledgeable group of professionals, and I look forward to future opportunities to share and learn at similar events.\n\n**Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?**\n\n“The Dude abides” The Dude — The Big Lebowski\n\nThis quote is from my favorite film, The Big Lebowski. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and to me it reflects the acceptance of life’s challenges. In the book, “The Dude and the Zen Master”, they talk about Zen principles and how the Dude reflects these throughout the movie and how you can throughout your life. It’s a simple quote that helps me remember whatever is going on through your personal or work life you can survive. Take it in your stride, remember what matters, and also, “The Dude abides”.\n\n**None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**\n\nFor me that person would be my current colleague and Head of Global Consulting at LoopUp, [Graham Cropley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamcropley/). He is someone I’ve had the pleasure of working with throughout my career across multiple businesses and has allowed me to flourish as a consultant. Graham has been a constant source of knowledge and encouragement towards hitting my career goals.\n\nA story that comes to mind is when Graham and I were working together before LoopUp there was a security workshop that needed to be completed by a couple of consultants, and he thought of me as I’d shown interest. We met up the night before the presentation and I was freaking out as it was my first presentation in front of such a big customer and I didn’t feel like I knew the material well enough. We spent time going through the deck and he said to me “I don’t know this either, let’s work it out”. You don’t have to know everything all the time, but if you’re willing to spend the effort to work it out it goes a long way.\n\n**How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?**\n\nAs a Microsoft Teams MVP, I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time to sharing my expertise with the community. Through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements, I’ve helped others understand and leverage Microsoft Teams and other technologies to improve their workflows and communication.\n\n**Ok wonderful. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview. Can you tell us about the cutting-edge communication tech that you are working on? How do you think that will help people?**\n\nOur cloud telephony solution at [LoopUp](https://loopup.com/us/) aims to transform Microsoft Teams from an internal collaboration tool into a fully-fledged unified communications platform. This allows users to make and receive external phone calls from any Teams-enabled device, providing a seamless and integrated communication experience.\n\n**How do you think this might change the world?**\n\nBy enabling PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, users can stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment.\n\n**Keeping “**[**Black Mirror**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror)**” in mind, can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about?**\n\nWith Black Mirror in mind, having constant contact available via mobile devices and Microsoft Teams could potentially blur the boundaries between work and personal life. It’s important to make sure there is enough education out there about having a healthy work-life balance.\n\n**Was there a “tipping point” that led you to this breakthrough? Can you tell us that story?**\n\nI saw the immense potential of integrating telephony with Teams and it motivated me to pursue this path, join LoopUp and share my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I’m excited to continue exploring new possibilities in communication technology.\n\n**What do you need to lead this technology to widespread adoption?**\n\nWidespread adoption of Microsoft Teams is already prevalent in my opinion, however, to stay ahead of the competition there still needs to be a steady stream of feature updates that will make Teams telephony more usable across different organizations. At LoopUp we also can increase this widespread adoption due to our increased global coverage of 66 countries and cost-saving capabilities which will make these technologies more accessible.\n\n**The pandemic has changed so many things about the way we behave. One of them of course is how we work and how we communicate in our work. How do you think your innovation might be able to address the new needs that have arisen as a result of the pandemic?**\n\nOur solution enables PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, allowing users to stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment where employees need to be able to communicate seamlessly regardless of their location. Along with this, moving to a cloud-based telephony system can significantly reduce costs associated with maintaining traditional phone systems. It also offers scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust their communication infrastructure as they grow. This is particularly important in the post-pandemic world, where many organizations are looking to optimize their operations and reduce expenses.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n**What are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started” and why?**\n\n1.  **Embrace Continuous Learning**: Tech evolves rapidly, and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is crucial. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n2.  **Networking is Key**: Building a strong professional network can open up many opportunities. Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with peers. These relationships can provide support, advice, and potential career advancements.\n3.  **Don’t Fear Failure**: Failure is a part of the learning process. Each setback is an opportunity to learn and improve.\n4.  **Work-Life Balance Matters**: It’s easy to get consumed by work, especially in a fast-paced industry. Prioritize your well-being and maintain a healthy work-life balance. This will help you stay productive and avoid burnout.\n5.  **Soft Skills are Essential**: Technical skills are important, but soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are equally valuable. These skills will help you collaborate effectively and advance in your career.\n\n**You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)**\n\nOne thing that I believe is very important is supporting lifelong learning by providing resources and platforms for continuous learning and skill development. This would help people stay updated with the latest in technological advancements and make you available to adapt to the changing job market and technology solutions.\n\n**How can our readers further follow your work online?**\n\n**LinkedIn** *—* [https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/)\n\n**YouTube** *—* [https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett](https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett)\n\n**Thank you so much for the time you spent doing this interview.

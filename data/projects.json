The blog is intended for LoopUp's marketing team and will target enterprise IT, unified communications (UC), and digital transformation decision-makers operating at scale across multiple geographies. The tone should be expert, pragmatic, and warm, written in the voice of a LoopUp insider.\n\n## Initial understanding\n\n- Format: Blog article, approx 500 words.\n- Topic: Overview of LoopUp Cloud Telephony services.\n- Audience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation leaders.\n- Aim: Guide through business context, definitions, how it works, trade-offs, and summary.\n- Terminology: Use exact terms (Microsoft Teams Phone, Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans, PSTN defined on first use).\n- Style: No buzzwords or filler. Concrete examples, recognition of reader's friction, genuine expertise, varied sentence rhythm.\n\n## Clarification Needed\n\n- Are there specific LoopUp services, features, or pain points the client wants highlighted?\n- Is there a preferred business context or a particular operational friction the blog should address?\n- Does the client want the overview focused on Microsoft Teams integration, global reach, cost structure, migration challenges, or another angle?\n\n## Next Step\n\nI will ask the client what particular LoopUp Cloud Telephony services or business context they want emphasized in the overview before drafting the blog.\n",

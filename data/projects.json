      "documentContent": "# Celebrating Zach Bennett: Our Very Own Microsoft Teams MVP\n\nWe're absolutely thrilled to shine a spotlight on someone who's been making serious waves in the Microsoft Teams community — our Principal Architect, Zach Bennett.\n\nZach has just been renewed as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Microsoft Teams — and let's be clear about what that means. Out of the millions of IT professionals working with Microsoft technologies across the United Kingdom, only 18 hold this title for Teams. Eighteen. Microsoft hand-picks these people because they're not just good at what they do — they're among the absolute best in the world, actively shaping the future of how enterprises communicate. Zach is one of them.\n\n## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion\n\nZach's journey is one of those brilliant \"follow your passion\" stories. He studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during his placement year at General Electric, he had a realisation that would shape his career: the big corporate life wasn't for him. He wanted somewhere more intimate, where he could wear many hats and really make an impact.\n\nThat Computer Science foundation matters. It’s the kind of degree that forces you to think in systems: how complex parts connect, where failures actually come from, and how to troubleshoot methodically when the obvious answer isn’t the right one. Pair that with a real industry placement inside a huge organisation, and you get an engineer who can speak both languages — the technical detail _and_ the messy reality of how big enterprises operate.\n\nIt also explains a lot about Zach today: he’s not just “good with Teams.” He’s good at the underlying problem—designing, debugging, and scaling real-world communications systems that have to work for thousands of people, across multiple countries, under real constraints.\n\nHe started out managing Cisco phone systems, but quickly found his true calling in the Microsoft ecosystem — first with development work, then Skype for Business, and eventually discovering his passion in voice deployments. As he puts it: \"The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate… What's next?\" That forward-thinking mindset has driven everything since.\n\n## What Zach Actually Does (It's a Lot)\n\nAs Principal Architect at LoopUp, Zach sits at the heart of our most complex global telephony deployments. This isn't just \"set up some phones\" work — it's enterprise-scale transformation for multinational organisations operating across 100+ countries.\n\nDay to day, Zach leads the full journey: strategic planning, proof-of-concept design, and multi-site rollouts that can span dozens of countries simultaneously. He works directly with global enterprises to migrate them away from fragmented legacy PBX systems — often a patchwork of regional carriers, each with their own contracts, billing, support teams, and headaches — onto a unified Microsoft Teams Phone platform.\n\nHe advises on Microsoft licensing optimisation, security configurations, and modern workplace capabilities, ensuring clients don't just get Teams Phone working, but get the absolute maximum value from it. Whether it's navigating the complexities of Operator Connect, architecting Direct Routing solutions via our Cloud Telephony Platform, or helping organisations tackle tricky markets like China and India, Zach's the one making it happen.\n\nIn short: when a Fortune 500 company needs to consolidate their global voice infrastructure and actually make it work seamlessly, Zach's the architect they turn to.\n\n## Building for the Community\n\nWhat really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.\n\nHis blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to Voice Isolation features, the new Queues App capabilities, and the latest Direct Routing troubleshooting tools rolling out in Teams Admin Center.\n\nHis YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more. And then there's **teamstts.com** — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live, using the same voices Microsoft Teams uses on the backend. If you've ever had a company name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.\n\n## On Stage and Around the World\n\nZach's passion for teaching extends well beyond the screen. One of his most memorable career moments came at Comms vNext 2024 in Denver, Colorado — his first major international speaking engagement — where he presented \"Is Teams Ready To Be Your Contact Center?\" to an audience of Microsoft communications professionals from around the globe.\n\nSince then, he's become a regular on the conference circuit. Just last November, he was at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, co-presenting \"Unlock MS Teams Phone Globally: Insights from World's Leading Brands\" with our own Andrew Birch. He's a fixture at Commsverse (the UK's premier Microsoft Teams conference) and is already confirmed to speak at Commsverse 2026.\n\nHe's also been featured across industry publications — Authority Magazine, AI TechPark, NODE Magazine — sharing his insights on the future of enterprise communications and AI-driven telephony.\n\n## The Person Behind the Professional\n\nHere's something you might not know about Zach: his favourite quote is \"The Dude abides\" from The Big Lebowski. As he explains it, it's about accepting life's challenges, taking things in your stride, and remembering what truly matters. Pretty solid life philosophy, if you ask us.\n\nHe's also quick to credit others for his success — particularly Graham Cropley, our Head of Global Consulting, who Zach describes as a constant source of knowledge and encouragement throughout his career. And on the personal front, 2025 has been extra special: Zach recently welcomed a baby girl into the world.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWith Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — AI-powered features, Copilot integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge, both for our clients and for the wider community.\n\nSo here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, new dad, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast. Congratulations on another well-deserved year of recognition!\n\n---\n\n_Want to follow Zach's work?

In his recent AI TechPark interview, Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp, shares why many enterprises still struggle with fragmented systems and what it takes to modernize voice on a global scale.\n\nZach makes a clear case that relying on local carriers country by country creates hidden costs, inconsistent experiences, and serious obstacles when businesses want to expand or adapt quickly. He explains how moving telephony into the cloud and integrating it directly with Microsoft Teams changes the game, giving enterprises the ability to scale instantly and manage everything under one global framework.\n\nHe also stresses that voice should not sit on the sidelines of co\n\nTitle: AITech Interview with Zach Bennett, Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp\nAuthor: AI TechPark\nPublished Date: 2025-09-23T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://ai-techpark.com/aitech-interview-with-zach-bennett/\nText: AITech Interview: Zach Bennett, Microsoft Teams MVP\n\nAI-driven cloud telephony elevates productivity and workflow precision in modern enterprise communication.\n\nZach, as a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, could you share how your journey has evolved within the world of Microsoft technologies and voice technologies, and how it led you to your current role?\n\nI started my career managing and supporting Cisco phone systems. Since making the move into the Microsoft technology stack, I’ve seen constant enhancements and innovations whilst supporting, managing, consulting, and architecting against the industry leader in voice technologies and UC platforms. This has led me into a role that I love where I can help truly global organizations migrate from their aging Phone Systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. It has driven me to help the wider voice community and as a result for my contributions I was awarded by Microsoft who invited me to join their Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals group of \n\nTitle: Zach Bennett - Commsverse\nAuthor: \nURL: https://commsverse.com/speaker/zach-bennett\nText: Zach Bennett - Commsverse\n![Commsverse - The Microsoft Teams Conference] \nI have been immersed in the world of Microsoft technologies since graduating from university 8 years ago, with a special focus on Voice technologies. Throughout my career, I have found joy in sharing my expertise and knowledge with others. Teaching has always been a passion of mine, and I am eager to expand my reach and connect with a broader technical community through engaging talks and presentations.\nCurrently, I am a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, a leading Cloud Telephony provider. At LoopUp, we specialise in offering PSTN solutions built around Microsoft Teams and are proud participants in the Operator Connect program. In my day-to-day role, I work closely with global organisations, assisting them in transitioning from their outdated PBX systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. Leveraging Operator Connect or Direct Routing via the LoopUp Cloud Telephony Platform, I help these organisations seamlessly migrate and unlock the full potential of Microsoft Teams for their communication needs\n![Commsverse - The Microsoft Teams Conference] \n#####\n\nTitle: Our MVP | LoopUp\nURL: https://loopup.com/us/company/our-mvp/\nText: Our MVP | LoopUp\n\n- [Contact us] \n- [Careers] \n- [Our MVP] \n- [Team] \n- [About] \n- [+1 (877) 447-8867] \n\n# Meet Zach Bennett\n\n## Microsoft Teams MVP | Principal Architect at LoopUp\n\n[LinkedIn] [YouTube] \n\n## Background and education\n\nZach studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University.

As Principal Architect at LoopUp, he leads global deployments of Microsoft Teams Phone for enterprise clients — from strategic planning and proof-of-concept to multi-site rollouts.

Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started? I studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during my year in industry at General Electric, I realized that the big company life might not be for me. I wanted a workplace that was more intimate, where I could wear many hats and help out wherever possible. My interest in Microsoft technologies led me to development work, and eventually, I found my passion in voice deployments with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is where I discovered what I truly love to do, and I’ve been pursuing it ever since. The announcement and success of Microsoft Teams opened up a whole new dimension to my career. I delved into the telephony side of Teams, and I enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagement\n\nTitle: Unlock MS Teams phone globally; Insights from world's leading ...\nAuthor: \nURL: https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/ODSP1453\nText: Unlock MS Teams phone globally; Insights from world&#x27;s leading brands\n\n",

Importantly, this is via Windows Desktop, Teams for Mac Desktop, and Teams for iOS and Android. This is great because we are seeing features released across many ways people use Teams at the same time.\n\nThis feature currently has the following requirements:\n\n- Calling Plans\n- United States and Canada\n\nThis feature will be manageable via the Teams Admin Center by the end of the rollout of this feature also.\n\nAlthough I think this is a valuable addition for US & Canada based customers are we still seeing a demand for SMS\n\n",

                  "content": "# Celebrating Zach Bennett: Our Very Own Microsoft Teams MVP\n\nWe're absolutely thrilled to shine a spotlight on someone who's been making serious waves in the Microsoft Teams community — our Principal Architect, Zach Bennett.\n\nFor those who don't know, Zach was recently renewed as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in Microsoft Teams. That's not just a fancy title — it's recognition from Microsoft themselves that Zach is one of the go-to voices helping shape how organisations around the world use Teams Phone.\n\n## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion\n\nZach's journey into the world of voice technology started with managing Cisco phone systems, but he quickly found his true calling (pun intended) in the Microsoft ecosystem. With over a decade of hands-on experience in unified communications, he's become the person global enterprises turn to when they need to migrate from clunky, outdated PBX systems to modern Microsoft Teams Phone deployments.\n\nHere at LoopUp, Zach leads some of our most complex global telephony projects — working with multinational organisations to roll out Teams Phone across dozens of countries. It's the kind of work that requires deep technical expertise, but also the ability to see the bigger picture and help clients navigate the real-world challenges of going global with their communications.\n\n## Building for the Community\n\nWhat really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.\n\nHis blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to the latest features rolling out in Teams Admin Center. His YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more.\n\nAnd then there's teamstts.com — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live. If you've ever had a client name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.\n\n## On Stage and On the Road\n\nZach's passion for teaching extends beyond the screen. He's a regular speaker at industry conferences like Commsverse and Comms vNext, and just last November he was representing LoopUp at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco. He's been featured in AI TechPark, Authority Magazine, and various industry spotlights discussing the future of enterprise telephony.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWith Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — SMS integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge.\n\nSo here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast. Congratulations on another well-deserved year of recognition!\n\n---\n\n*Want to follow Zach's work? Check out his blog at zachb.uk or connect with him on LinkedIn.*\n"

Since making the move into the Microsoft technology stack, I’ve seen constant enhancements and innovations whilst supporting, managing, consulting, and architecting against the industry leader in voice technologies and UC platforms. This has led me into a role that I love where I can help truly global organizations migrate from their aging Phone Systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. It has driven me to help the wider voice community and as a result for my contributions I was awarded by Microsoft who invited me to join their Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals group of leaders.\n\n**AI is increasingly transforming industries, including telecommunications. In your view, how is AI currently impacting the telecommunications sector, particularly with regard to cloud-based communication systems like Microsoft Teams?**\n\nVoice can often be forgotten in this world of fast-moving technology. However, AI is so wide reaching that customers are looking for what sort of AI functionality they’ll be able to utilize in their Phone Systems right now. Cloud-based communication systems like Microsoft Teams are front runners in this aspect as they offer some AI capabilities already as part of their Copilot M365 offering.\n\nThe integration of telecom call data into enterprise datasets is crucial for AI analysis. What are the implications for enterprises if they fail to include telecom data, and how does this impact the value of AI within those organizations?\n\nAI becomes invaluable if you’re an organization that is doing everything right including valuing your data collection and capturing emails, meetings and CRM data, but are missing out on call data. Without that call data, you’re not providing the full picture to your AI service because you’re missing out on a core communication stream of data for your company. This can cause inaccuracies in your data and skew trends.\n\n**Given your experience with transitioning organizations from traditional PBX systems to Microsoft Teams Phone, how do you think AI can enhance productivity when implemented correctly within these platforms?**\n\nIf you’re using a Phone System and provider that can allow you to utilize AI in the correct way, it can allow your user’s experience of the Phone System to be greatly enhanced. For example, when taking calls, being able to summarize the call before transferring that onto another colleague gives them the information they need to act effectively and efficiently on the call. Also, providing real-time transcriptions that users can refer back to and integrate through the [AI agent](https://ai-techpark.com/ai-agents-vs-ai-assistants-key-differences/) on the call can massively increase productivity.\n\n**With the growing role of AI in enterprise environments, what are the key challenges businesses face when integrating telecom data with AI technologies, and how can they overcome these hurdles?**\n\nI believe the challenges of integrating telecom data with AI will be very similar to challenges that we’ve already seen with AI. These challenges — such as security and compliance — can be seen as sensitive information for telecom data. It is important to make sure you have adopted advanced security measures such as encryption and regular audits so that you are compliant with regulations. Scalability is another challenge as telecom data can be fast, complex, and big, so making sure your AI system can handle this increase of data is key.\n\n**As cloud-based telephony and AI converge, how do you envision the future of communication systems in large enterprises, and what role will platforms like Microsoft Teams play in shaping this future?**\n\n[Cloud-based telephony such as Microsoft Teams are already shaping the future of how AI works with your phone system by innovating and offering AI features directly in Microsoft Teams Phone.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Cloud-based%20telephony%20such%20as%20Microsoft%20Teams%20are%20already%20shaping%20the%20future%20of%20how%20AI%20works%20with%20your%20phone%20system%20by%20innovating%20and%20offering%20AI%20features%20directly%20in%20Microsoft%20Teams%20Phone.) Its seamless integration with other Microsoft 365 tolls and services enables a truly unified communication experience.\n\nI envision the future of communication will be about creating seamless, intelligent interactions that enhance both employee productivity and customer experience. [AI-powered](https://ai-techpark.com/ai-powered-mental-health-workplace-strategies/) communication hubs, context-aware messaging systems, and automated workflow integration are some of the innovations that will drive this transformation. Microsoft Teams is at the forefront of this evolution, offering features such as AI-driven automation, real-time speech analytics and AI Agent driven contact centers.\n\n**AI has the potential to enhance communication workflows. How can enterprises ensure they’re getting the most productivity benefits from AI while also maintaining a high level of security and compliance in their communication systems?**\n\n***Choosing an AI service that has deep integration with the rest of your technology stack and that you trust would be a good place to start.*** Something like Copilot for example, if you’re using Microsoft Teams Phone, is good for seamless integration. You should ensure that training and awareness has been covered for your users to confirm they are aware of security and compliance implications when using AI. It is also important to provide them with the correct education around this so they’re safe and not unintentionally breaking compliance.\n\n**What role do telecom providers like LoopUp play in ensuring seamless AI integration for businesses using Microsoft Teams, and how does this impact the overall performance of communication systems?**\n\nTelecom providers like LoopUp play a big role in making sure customers are correctly informed about the benefits of AI and how to use them safely within their organizations. We take a consultative approach when it comes to newer technologies like this and inform customers of best practices and how they can enhance their current communication workflows and achieve more out of their communication systems.\n\n**Many organizations are still operating on outdated PBX systems. What are the most significant advantages of transitioning to cloud-based systems like Microsoft Teams Phone with the addition of AI-enhanced capabilities?**\n\nThere are so many to choose from but here are 3 that resonate a lot when I’m talking to customers:\n\n● Take advantage of advanced calling features – Microsoft Teams offers many advanced calling features which can enhance how you currently use your phone system and gives users massive productivity boosts.  \n● Cost Savings – Cloud based systems eliminate the need for expensive on-premises hardware and reduce ongoing management and maintenance costs.  \n● Scalability and futureproofing – Making sure that your phone system is also able to grow with you as a business, and having the ability and flexibility to add or remove additional users without the need to invest in new infrastructure.\n\n**What are some of the most exciting developments you foresee in AI and telecommunications, and how can businesses start preparing for these innovations to stay ahead in the competitive landscape?**\n\nAI is only going to grow when it comes to the telecommunications features we’ve already mentioned such as real-time transcription, summarization, and AI agents — these are only the start. As companies like Microsoft see the increased adoption of Copilot against Microsoft Teams Phone, new functionalities will start to be released that will enhance user productivity, streamline workflows and incentivize customers to try out these features. If you haven’t already, look to modernize your phone system and move it to the Cloud to give your business these advantages that will make you well placed to embrace these AI features.\n\n![](https://ai-techpark.com/wp-content/uploads/aitpp.jpg)\n\n## **Zach Bennett**\n\nMicrosoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp\n\n-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/)\n\nCurrently, I am a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, a leading Cloud Telephony provider.

Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n\nT*he telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate with people all over the world. But then came email and took it to the next level. And then came text messaging. And then came video calls. And so on…What’s next? What’s just around the corner?*\n\n*In this interview series, called ‘The Future Of Communication Technology’ we are interviewing leaders of tech or telecom companies who are helping to develop emerging communication technologies and the next generation of how we communicate and connect with each other.*\n\n*As a part of this series, I had the pleasure of interviewing Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp.*\n\n*Zach Bennett has been immersed in the world of Microsoft technologies since graduating from university 9 years ago, where he had a special focus on voice technologies. Throughout his career, Zach has found joy in sharing his expertise and knowledge with others. Teaching has always been a passion of his, and he is eager to expand his reach and connect with a broader technical community through engaging talks and presentations.*\n\n*Currently, Zach is a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, a leading Cloud Telephony provider. At LoopUp, the company specializes in offering PSTN solutions built around Microsoft Teams and is proud to participate in the Operator Connect program. In his day-to-day role, Zach works closely with global organizations, assisting them in transitioning from their outdated PBX systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. Leveraging Operator Connect or Direct Routing via the LoopUp Cloud Telephony Platform, he helps these organizations seamlessly migrate and unlock the full potential of Microsoft Teams for their communication needs.*\n\n**Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started?**\n\nI studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during my year in industry at General Electric, I realized that the big company life might not be for me. I wanted a workplace that was more intimate, where I could wear many hats and help out wherever possible.\n\nMy interest in Microsoft technologies led me to development work, and eventually, I found my passion in voice deployments with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is where I discovered what I truly love to do, and I’ve been pursuing it ever since.\n\nThe announcement and success of Microsoft Teams opened up a whole new dimension to my career. I delved into the telephony side of Teams, and I enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey led me to LoopUp, where we have a revolutionary approach to Microsoft Teams calling and the technology behind it, which I now help deliver to our customers. Along with this, my continued commitment to community work has offered me the opportunity to join the Microsoft MVP program specialising in Microsoft Teams where I am 1/18 in the UK.\n\n**Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?**\n\nOne of the most interesting and memorable experiences in my career happened when I was invited to talk at CommsVNext in Denver, CO. As a Microsoft Teams MVP, I had the opportunity to present at this prestigious international event, which is dedicated to Microsoft Communications and Collaborations Technologies.\n\nThe event was held at the hotel in downtown Denver, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. I remember preparing extensively for my presentation called “Is Teams ready to be your Contact Center?” where I explored the capabilities of Microsoft Teams in handling complex communication needs and shared insights on maximizing its effectiveness.\n\nWhat made this experience truly special was the sense of community and the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals. The event was well-organized, with all sessions, exhibitors, and food in close proximity, making it easy to engage with attendees and participate in various discussions.\n\nDuring my talk, I shared real-world customer scenarios and solutions, which resonated well with the audience. The feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive, and it was gratifying to see how my insights could help others in their journey with Microsoft Teams.\n\nOverall, CommsVNext in Denver was an unforgettable experience that reinforced my passion for Microsoft technologies and the importance of community engagement. It was a privilege to be part of such a vibrant and knowledgeable group of professionals, and I look forward to future opportunities to share and learn at similar events.\n\n**Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?**\n\n“The Dude abides” The Dude — The Big Lebowski\n\nThis quote is from my favorite film, The Big Lebowski. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and to me it reflects the acceptance of life’s challenges. In the book, “The Dude and the Zen Master”, they talk about Zen principles and how the Dude reflects these throughout the movie and how you can throughout your life. It’s a simple quote that helps me remember whatever is going on through your personal or work life you can survive. Take it in your stride, remember what matters, and also, “The Dude abides”.\n\n**None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**\n\nFor me that person would be my current colleague and Head of Global Consulting at LoopUp, [Graham Cropley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamcropley/). He is someone I’ve had the pleasure of working with throughout my career across multiple businesses and has allowed me to flourish as a consultant. Graham has been a constant source of knowledge and encouragement towards hitting my career goals.\n\nA story that comes to mind is when Graham and I were working together before LoopUp there was a security workshop that needed to be completed by a couple of consultants, and he thought of me as I’d shown interest. We met up the night before the presentation and I was freaking out as it was my first presentation in front of such a big customer and I didn’t feel like I knew the material well enough. We spent time going through the deck and he said to me “I don’t know this either, let’s work it out”. You don’t have to know everything all the time, but if you’re willing to spend the effort to work it out it goes a long way.\n\n**How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?**\n\nAs a Microsoft Teams MVP, I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time to sharing my expertise with the community. Through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements, I’ve helped others understand and leverage Microsoft Teams and other technologies to improve their workflows and communication.\n\n**Ok wonderful. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview. Can you tell us about the cutting-edge communication tech that you are working on? How do you think that will help people?**\n\nOur cloud telephony solution at [LoopUp](https://loopup.com/us/) aims to transform Microsoft Teams from an internal collaboration tool into a fully-fledged unified communications platform. This allows users to make and receive external phone calls from any Teams-enabled device, providing a seamless and integrated communication experience.\n\n**How do you think this might change the world?**\n\nBy enabling PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, users can stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment.\n\n**Keeping “**[**Black Mirror**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror)**” in mind, can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about?**\n\nWith Black Mirror in mind, having constant contact available via mobile devices and Microsoft Teams could potentially blur the boundaries between work and personal life. It’s important to make sure there is enough education out there about having a healthy work-life balance.\n\n**Was there a “tipping point” that led you to this breakthrough? Can you tell us that story?**\n\nI saw the immense potential of integrating telephony with Teams and it motivated me to pursue this path, join LoopUp and share my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I’m excited to continue exploring new possibilities in communication technology.\n\n**What do you need to lead this technology to widespread adoption?**\n\nWidespread adoption of Microsoft Teams is already prevalent in my opinion, however, to stay ahead of the competition there still needs to be a steady stream of feature updates that will make Teams telephony more usable across different organizations. At LoopUp we also can increase this widespread adoption due to our increased global coverage of 66 countries and cost-saving capabilities which will make these technologies more accessible.\n\n**The pandemic has changed so many things about the way we behave. One of them of course is how we work and how we communicate in our work. How do you think your innovation might be able to address the new needs that have arisen as a result of the pandemic?**\n\nOur solution enables PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, allowing users to stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment where employees need to be able to communicate seamlessly regardless of their location. Along with this, moving to a cloud-based telephony system can significantly reduce costs associated with maintaining traditional phone systems. It also offers scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust their communication infrastructure as they grow. This is particularly important in the post-pandemic world, where many organizations are looking to optimize their operations and reduce expenses.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n**What are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started” and why?**\n\n1.  **Embrace Continuous Learning**: Tech evolves rapidly, and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is crucial. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n2.  **Networking is Key**: Building a strong professional network can open up many opportunities. Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with peers. These relationships can provide support, advice, and potential career advancements.\n3.  **Don’t Fear Failure**: Failure is a part of the learning process. Each setback is an opportunity to learn and improve.\n4.  **Work-Life Balance Matters**: It’s easy to get consumed by work, especially in a fast-paced industry. Prioritize your well-being and maintain a healthy work-life balance. This will help you stay productive and avoid burnout.\n5.  **Soft Skills are Essential**: Technical skills are important, but soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are equally valuable. These skills will help you collaborate effectively and advance in your career.\n\n**You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)**\n\nOne thing that I believe is very important is supporting lifelong learning by providing resources and platforms for continuous learning and skill development. This would help people stay updated with the latest in technological advancements and make you available to adapt to the changing job market and technology solutions.\n\n**How can our readers further follow your work online?**\n\n**LinkedIn** *—* [https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/)\n\n**YouTube** *—* [https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett](https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett)\n\n**Thank you so much for the time you spent doing this interview.

During a placement year at General Electric, he realised he preferred a working environment where he could take on diverse responsibilities rather than a conventional large-company structure.\n\n## Professional expertise\n\nZach has over a decade of experience in Microsoft unified-communications (UC) and voice solutions — in particular focusing on telephony and voice integration with collaboration tools. As Principal Architect at LoopUp, he leads global deployments of Microsoft Teams Phone for enterprise clients — from strategic planning and proof-of-concept to multi-site rollouts. He advises organisations on optimising Microsoft licensing, security, and modern workplace capabilities to ensure enterprises can fully leverage Teams and cloud-based telephony.\n\n[![Zach Bennett thought leadership](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2025/12/zach-bennett-thought-leadership.jpg)](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/multinational-businesses-are-struggling-to-breathe-under-the-weight-of-geographically-bound-telephony)\n\n## Thought leadership and community engagement\n\nZach participates actively in the broader technical community: he writes technical blogs, produces educational content, and delivers talks and presentations on voice deployments and modern communications. He was featured in a 2025 interview discussing the future of communication technology, articulating how cloud telephony and integrated communication platforms can transform enterprise communication.\n\n## Philosophy and approach\n\nZach balances technical acumen with a consultative mindset — he prioritises continuous learning, staying abreast of evolving telecom and UC trends, and helping clients navigate migrations from legacy PBX systems to cloud-native solutions. In his own words (from a public interview): “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?” — reflecting his forward-looking view on communication technologies.\n\n> “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?”\n\n## Role at LoopUp and impact\n\nAt LoopUp — a global cloud-communications provider offering managed telephony around Microsoft Teams and operating across 100+ countries — Zach ensures enterprises can modernise voice infrastructure with minimal friction.\n\nHis work supports customers in consolidating fragmented telephony systems, reducing cost and complexity, and providing a scalable, secure, and consistent global communication platform.\n\n## Read Zach’s latest posts\n\n#### [Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here](https://loopup.com/us/resource-center/from-our-mvp/redefining-global-communication-the-future-is-already-here/ \"Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here\")\n\nRemote collaboration is now the norm, but enterprise voice hasn’t kept pace.

Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started? I studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during my year in industry at General Electric, I realized that the big company life might not be for me. I wanted a workplace that was more intimate, where I could wear many hats and help out wherever possible. My interest in Microsoft technologies led me to development work, and eventually, I found my passion in voice deployments with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is where I discovered what I truly love to do, and I’ve been pursuing it ever sinc\n\nTitle: Meet our alumni\nAuthor: \nPublished Date: 2022-12-08T12:06:58.000Z\nURL: https://mmu.ac.uk/alumni/community/meet\nText: [Skip to main content] \n\n- [Alumni home] \n- [Benefits] \n - [Certificates and transcripts] \n - [Library membership] \n- [Community] \n - [International networks] \n - [Hong Kong chapter] \n - [Malaysia network] \n - [Meet our alumni] \n - [International ambassadors] \n - [Ambassadors in Africa] \n - [Ambassadors in Asia] \n - [Ambassadors in Europe] \n - [Ambassadors in the Middle East] \n - [Ambassadors in North America] \n - [Ambassadors in South America] \n - [Alumni by job sector] \n - [Business and finance] \n - [Creative arts] \n - [Culture, sport and tourism] \n - [Digital, web and media] \n - [Education and teaching] \n - [Fashion, design and retail] \n - [Health, wellbeing and social care] \n - [Law and the public sector] \n - [Marketing, advertising and PR] \n - [Science, engineering and the environment] \n - [Notable alumni] \n- [Volunteer] \n - [Register to volunteer] \n - [Imp\n\nTitle: Manchester Metropolitan University: Employee Directory | ZoomInfo.com\nAuthor: \nPublished Date: 2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://www.zoominfo.com/pic/manchester-metropolitan-university/86312397\nText: Trying To Reach Decision Makers?\n\nFind 4,810 employees from Manchester Metropolitan University\n\nStart Free\n\n[![logo for Manchester Metropolitan University]] \n\n# [Manchester Metropolitan University] Employee Directory\n\nManchester Metropolitan University corporate office is located in All Saints Building All Saints, Manchester, Lancashire, M15 6BH, United Kingdom and has 4,810 employees.\n\nmanchester metropolitan university\n\nmanchester metropolitan university business school\n\nmanchester law school\n\nhollings faculty\n\nmanchester metropolitan students union\n\nfaculty of education alumni - manchester metropoli...\n\n## Employees by Department\n\nDepartments\n\nNumber of employees\n\nMarketing\n\n361\n\n![] \n\nOperations\n\n308\n\n![] \n\nHuman Resources\n\n220\n\n![] \n\nInformation Technology\n\n211\n\n![] \n\nFin\n\nTitle: Faculty of Science and Engineering staff\nAuthor: \nPublished Date: 2024-05-17T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://www.mmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/science-engineering/staff\nText: Faculty of Science and Engineering staff | Manchester Metropolitan University\n[Skip to main content] \n[Manchester Metropolitan University] \nSearchOpen menuClose menu\nSearch mmu.ac.ukSearch\n[Close menu] \n# Our people\nWe have around 800 academic and support staff across the Faculty of Science and Engineering.

                  "content": "# Celebrating Zach Bennett: Our Very Own Microsoft Teams MVP\n\nWe're absolutely thrilled to shine a spotlight on someone who's been making serious waves in the Microsoft Teams community — our Principal Architect, Zach Bennett.\n\nFor those who don't know, Zach was recently renewed as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in Microsoft Teams. And here's the thing — he's one of only 18 Teams MVPs in the entire UK. That's not just a fancy title; it's recognition from Microsoft themselves that Zach is one of the go-to voices helping shape how organisations around the world use Teams Phone.\n\n## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion\n\nZach's journey is one of those brilliant \"follow your passion\" stories. He studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during his placement year at General Electric, he had a realisation that would shape his career: the big corporate life wasn't for him. He wanted somewhere more intimate, where he could wear many hats and really make an impact.\n\nHe started out managing Cisco phone systems, but quickly found his true calling in the Microsoft ecosystem — first with development work, then Skype for Business, and eventually discovering his passion in voice deployments. As he puts it: \"The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate… What's next?\" That forward-thinking mindset has driven everything since.\n\nNow, with over a decade of hands-on experience in unified communications, Zach leads some of our most complex global telephony projects here at LoopUp — helping multinational organisations across 100+ countries migrate from clunky legacy PBX systems to modern Microsoft Teams Phone.\n\n## Building for the Community\n\nWhat really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.\n\nHis blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to Voice Isolation features, the new Queues App capabilities, and the latest Direct Routing troubleshooting tools rolling out in Teams Admin Center.\n\nHis YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more. And then there's **teamstts.com** — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live, using the same voices Microsoft Teams uses on the backend. If you've ever had a company name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.\n\n## On Stage and Around the World\n\nZach's passion for teaching extends well beyond the screen. One of his most memorable career moments came at Comms vNext 2024 in Denver, Colorado — his first major international speaking engagement — where he presented \"Is Teams Ready To Be Your Contact Center?\" to an audience of Microsoft communications professionals from around the globe.\n\nSince then, he's become a regular on the conference circuit. Just last November, he was at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, co-presenting \"Unlock MS Teams Phone Globally: Insights from World's Leading Brands\" with our own Andrew Birch. He's a fixture at Commsverse (the UK's premier Microsoft Teams conference) and is already confirmed to speak at Commsverse 2026.\n\nHe's also been featured across industry publications — Authority Magazine, AI TechPark, NODE Magazine — sharing his insights on the future of enterprise communications and AI-driven telephony.\n\n## The Person Behind the Professional\n\nHere's something you might not know about Zach: his favourite quote is \"The Dude abides\" from The Big Lebowski. As he explains it, it's about accepting life's challenges, taking things in your stride, and remembering what truly matters. Pretty solid life philosophy, if you ask us.\n\nHe's also quick to credit others for his success — particularly Graham Cropley, our Head of Global Consulting, who Zach describes as a constant source of knowledge and encouragement throughout his career. And on the personal front, 2025 has been extra special: Zach recently welcomed a baby girl into the world.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWith Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — AI-powered features, Copilot integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge, both for our clients and for the wider community.\n\nSo here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, new dad, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast. Congratulations on another well-deserved year of recognition!\n\n---\n\n*Want to follow Zach's work?

And here's the thing — he's one of only 18 Teams MVPs in the entire UK. That's not just a fancy title; it's recognition from Microsoft themselves that Zach is one of the go-to voices helping shape how organisations around the world use Teams Phone.\n00006| \n00007| ## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion\n00008| \n00009| Zach's journey is one of those brilliant \"follow your passion\" stories. He studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during his placement year at General Electric, he had a realisation that would shape his career: the big corporate life wasn't for him. He wanted somewhere more intimate, where he could wear many hats and really make an impact.\n00010| \n00011| He started out managing Cisco phone systems, but quickly found his true calling in the Microsoft ecosystem — first with development work, then Skype for Business, and eventually discovering his passion in voice deployments. As he puts it: \"The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate… What's next?\" That forward-thinking mindset has driven everything since.\n00012| \n00013| Now, with over a decade of hands-on experience in unified communications, Zach leads some of our most complex global telephony projects here at LoopUp — helping multinational organisations across 100+ countries migrate from clunky legacy PBX systems to modern Microsoft Teams Phone.\n00014| \n00015| ## Building for the Community\n00016| \n00017| What really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.\n00018| \n00019| His blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to Voice Isolation features, the new Queues App capabilities, and the latest Direct Routing troubleshooting tools rolling out in Teams Admin Center.\n00020| \n00021| His YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more. And then there's **teamstts.com** — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live, using the same voices Microsoft Teams uses on the backend. If you've ever had a company name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.\n00022| \n00023| ## On Stage and Around the World\n00024| \n00025| Zach's passion for teaching extends well beyond the screen. One of his most memorable career moments came at Comms vNext 2024 in Denver, Colorado — his first major international speaking engagement — where he presented \"Is Teams Ready To Be Your Contact Center?\" to an audience of Microsoft communications professionals from around the globe.\n00026| \n00027| Since then, he's become a regular on the conference circuit. Just last November, he was at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, co-presenting \"Unlock MS Teams Phone Globally: Insights from World's Leading Brands\" with our own Andrew Birch. He's a fixture at Commsverse (the UK's premier Microsoft Teams conference) and is already confirmed to speak at Commsverse 2026.\n00028| \n00029| He's also been featured across industry publications — Authority Magazine, AI TechPark, NODE Magazine — sharing his insights on the future of enterprise communications and AI-driven telephony.\n00030| \n00031| ## The Person Behind the Professional\n00032| \n00033| Here's something you might not know about Zach: his favourite quote is \"The Dude abides\" from The Big Lebowski. As he explains it, it's about accepting life's challenges, taking things in your stride, and remembering what truly matters. Pretty solid life philosophy, if you ask us.\n00034| \n00035| He's also quick to credit others for his success — particularly Graham Cropley, our Head of Global Consulting, who Zach describes as a constant source of knowledge and encouragement throughout his career. And on the personal front, 2025 has been extra special: Zach recently welcomed a baby girl into the world.\n00036| \n00037| ## What's Next?\n00038| \n00039| With Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — AI-powered features, Copilot integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge, both for our clients and for the wider community.\n00040| \n00041| So here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, new dad, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast. Congratulations on another well-deserved year of recognition!\n00042| \n00043| ---\n00044| \n00045| _Want to follow Zach's work?

This isn't just \"set up some phones\" work — it's enterprise-scale transformation for multinational organisations operating across 100+ countries.\n\nDay to day, Zach leads the full journey: strategic planning, proof-of-concept design, and multi-site rollouts that can span dozens of countries simultaneously. He works directly with global enterprises to migrate them away from fragmented legacy PBX systems — often a patchwork of regional carriers, each with their own contracts, billing, support teams, and headaches — onto a unified Microsoft Teams Phone platform.\n\nHe advises on Microsoft licensing optimisation, security configurations, and modern workplace capabilities, ensuring clients don't just get Teams Phone working, but get the absolute maximum value from it. Whether it's navigating the complexities of Operator Connect, architecting Direct Routing solutions via our Cloud Telephony Platform, or helping organisations tackle tricky markets like China and India, Zach's the one making it happen.\n\nIn short: when a Fortune 500 company needs to consolidate their global voice infrastructure and actually make it work seamlessly, Zach's the architect they turn to."

And here's the thing — he's one of only 18 Teams MVPs in the entire UK. That's not just a fancy title; it's recognition from Microsoft themselves that Zach is one of the go-to voices helping shape how organisations around the world use Teams Phone.\n\n## From Cisco to Cloud Telephony Champion\n\nZach's journey is one of those brilliant \"follow your passion\" stories. He studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during his placement year at General Electric, he had a realisation that would shape his career: the big corporate life wasn't for him. He wanted somewhere more intimate, where he could wear many hats and really make an impact.\n\nHe started out managing Cisco phone systems, but quickly found his true calling in the Microsoft ecosystem — first with development work, then Skype for Business, and eventually discovering his passion in voice deployments. As he puts it: \"The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate… What's next?\" That forward-thinking mindset has driven everything since.\n\nNow, with over a decade of hands-on experience in unified communications, Zach leads some of our most complex global telephony projects here at LoopUp — helping multinational organisations across 100+ countries migrate from clunky legacy PBX systems to modern Microsoft Teams Phone.\n\n## Building for the Community\n\nWhat really sets Zach apart is how much he gives back. He doesn't just solve problems for clients — he shares what he learns with everyone.\n\nHis blog at zachb.uk has become a trusted resource for Teams admins everywhere, covering everything from whether Teams Premium is worth the investment to Voice Isolation features, the new Queues App capabilities, and the latest Direct Routing troubleshooting tools rolling out in Teams Admin Center.\n\nHis YouTube channel walks viewers through practical guides on Call Queues, Auto Attendants, and more. And then there's **teamstts.com** — a tool Zach built entirely for the community. It lets you test what Text-to-Speech will actually sound like in your Auto Attendants and Call Queues before you go live, using the same voices Microsoft Teams uses on the backend. If you've ever had a company name that TTS absolutely butchers, you'll understand why this is such a lifesaver.\n\n## On Stage and Around the World\n\nZach's passion for teaching extends well beyond the screen. One of his most memorable career moments came at Comms vNext 2024 in Denver, Colorado — his first major international speaking engagement — where he presented \"Is Teams Ready To Be Your Contact Center?\" to an audience of Microsoft communications professionals from around the globe.\n\nSince then, he's become a regular on the conference circuit. Just last November, he was at Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, co-presenting \"Unlock MS Teams Phone Globally: Insights from World's Leading Brands\" with our own Andrew Birch. He's a fixture at Commsverse (the UK's premier Microsoft Teams conference) and is already confirmed to speak at Commsverse 2026.\n\nHe's also been featured across industry publications — Authority Magazine, AI TechPark, NODE Magazine — sharing his insights on the future of enterprise communications and AI-driven telephony.\n\n## The Person Behind the Professional\n\nHere's something you might not know about Zach: his favourite quote is \"The Dude abides\" from The Big Lebowski. As he explains it, it's about accepting life's challenges, taking things in your stride, and remembering what truly matters. Pretty solid life philosophy, if you ask us.\n\nHe's also quick to credit others for his success — particularly Graham Cropley, our Head of Global Consulting, who Zach describes as a constant source of knowledge and encouragement throughout his career. And on the personal front, 2025 has been extra special: Zach recently welcomed a baby girl into the world.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWith Teams Phone continuing to evolve at a rapid pace — AI-powered features, Copilot integration, new admin tools, enhanced call handling — there's never been a more exciting time to be working in this space. And we couldn't be prouder to have Zach leading the charge, both for our clients and for the wider community.\n\nSo here's to Zach: MVP, architect, educator, tool builder, new dad, and all-around Teams Phone enthusiast.

Zach collects thank-you messages from strangers on the internet—and somehow turns them into real-world goodness. Which is a very long-winded way of saying: Zach is officially a **Microsoft MVP**, and we are extremely, unreasonably, enthusiastically proud.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what an MVP does, the short version is: they’re the folks who make tech feel less like an impossible maze and more like a friendly, well-lit hallway with clear signs and snacks. (Okay, the snacks aren’t guaranteed, but Zach would absolutely bring snacks if you asked nicely.) Microsoft MVPs are recognized for sharing knowledge, helping others succeed, and generally being a force for good in the community—often while running on a heroic combination of curiosity, caffeine, and “Sure, I can help with that.”\n\nAnd if you’ve spent five minutes around Zach, you know “Sure, I can help with that” is basically his personal brand.\n\nHe’s the person who can take a problem that looks like a tangled ball of holiday lights—APIs, configs, edge cases, one mysterious error message that only appears on Tuesdays—and calmly untie it while explaining what’s happening in plain English. The rest of us are standing there like, “Is it sorcery?” and Zach’s like, “No, it’s just a missing semicolon… plus three other things.”\n\nBut what makes this MVP recognition feel especially perfect is that Zach’s impact doesn’t stop at solving the thing in front of him. He shares the why, the how, and the “here’s how to avoid this next time,” so everyone around him gets better too. That’s the magic: not just fixing problems, but building confidence. The kind where someone who was afraid to touch a deployment pipeline is suddenly saying, “Actually, I think I can handle it.”\n\nAlso, Zach does all this while staying genuinely kind. No gatekeeping. No “Well, _obviously_…” energy. Just steady, friendly expertise—and the occasional well-timed joke that lands exactly when you needed your shoulders to unclench.\n\nSo today we’re celebrating Zach: for the hours spent answering questions, writing up explanations, sharing insights, encouraging others, and showing up for the community again and again. The Microsoft MVP title is an awesome recognition, but anyone who’s worked with him already knows the real story: Zach has been doing MVP-level work for a long time. Now it just comes with a badge.\n\nDrop a note, send a high-five, or unleash your favorite GIF in his general direction. Congratulations, Zach Bennett—our very own Microsoft MVP. May your builds be green, your logs be readable, and your coffee be strong.\n",

Zach Bennett? Zach collects thank-you messages from strangers on the internet—and somehow turns them into real-world goodness. Which is a very long-winded way of saying: Zach is officially a **Microsoft MVP**, and we are extremely, unreasonably, enthusiastically proud.\n00004| \n00005| If you’ve ever wondered what an MVP does, the short version is: they’re the folks who make tech feel less like an impossible maze and more like a friendly, well-lit hallway with clear signs and snacks. (Okay, the snacks aren’t guaranteed, but Zach would absolutely bring snacks if you asked nicely.) Microsoft MVPs are recognized for sharing knowledge, helping others succeed, and generally being a force for good in the community—often while running on a heroic combination of curiosity, caffeine, and “Sure, I can help with that.”\n00006| \n00007| And if you’ve spent five minutes around Zach, you know “Sure, I can help with that” is basically his personal brand.\n00008| \n00009| He’s the person who can take a problem that looks like a tangled ball of holiday lights—APIs, configs, edge cases, one mysterious error message that only appears on Tuesdays—and calmly untie it while explaining what’s happening in plain English. The rest of us are standing there like, “Is it sorcery?” and Zach’s like, “No, it’s just a missing semicolon… plus three other things.”\n00010| \n00011| But what makes this MVP recognition feel especially perfect is that Zach’s impact doesn’t stop at solving the thing in front of him. He shares the why, the how, and the “here’s how to avoid this next time,” so everyone around him gets better too. That’s the magic: not just fixing problems, but building confidence. The kind where someone who was afraid to touch a deployment pipeline is suddenly saying, “Actually, I think I can handle it.”\n00012| \n00013| Also, Zach does all this while staying genuinely kind. No gatekeeping. No “Well, _obviously_…” energy. Just steady, friendly expertise—and the occasional well-timed joke that lands exactly when you needed your shoulders to unclench.\n00014| \n00015| So today we’re celebrating Zach: for the hours spent answering questions, writing up explanations, sharing insights, encouraging others, and showing up for the community again and again. The Microsoft MVP title is an awesome recognition, but anyone who’s worked with him already knows the real story: Zach has been doing MVP-level work for a long time. Now it just comes with a badge.\n00016| \n00017| Drop a note, send a high-five, or unleash your favorite GIF in his general direction. Congratulations, Zach Bennett—our very own Microsoft MVP. May your builds be green, your logs be readable, and your coffee be strong.\n00018| \n\n(End of file - total 18 lines)\n</file>\n[Category+Skill Reminder]\n\nYou are an orchestrator agent.

      "documentContent": "---\ntitle: \"Teams Queues App: Your Calls, But Make It Hot\"\n---\n\nIf your support line currently feels like a group chat where everyone’s typing “who’s got this?” while the customer slowly turns into a fossil… hi. Microsoft Teams’ **Queues app** is here to make call queues feel less like a haunted house and more like a well-lit kitchen where everyone knows where the snacks are.\n\nAt a high level, the Queues app is a **Teams-native** place for handling customer calls (powered by Teams Phone) without bouncing between tools like a caffeinated pinball. Agents get a clean workspace to answer and place calls; leads get the “I’m watching you, but lovingly” controls; admins get less ticket-driven chaos. Everybody wins. Nobody has to open _yet another_ tab. (Your browser can finally unclench.)\n\n## Agents: the “I can handle this” era\n\nFirst, the basics—**incoming calls**. The Queues app supports handling incoming calls whether they’re **PSTN or VoIP**. That means when the phone rings, you don’t have to go spelunking through Teams to find the right place to answer. It’s right there, like your favorite person at the party.\n\nThen there’s the big relationship status upgrade: **Opt in / Opt out** of queues. You can join the queue when you’re ready to be perceived and dip out when you’re about to combust. And if your org uses **presence-based routing**, you’ll only get calls when you’re _both_ opted in _and_ set to **Available**. Translation: no more getting queue calls while you’re “Busy” because you’re eating lunch with the intensity of a courtroom drama.\n\nNeed to call customers back, but don’t want to dox your personal number? The Queues app lets you **make outbound calls on behalf of the call queue or auto attendant** you’re assigned to—so the customer sees your org, not “Mysterious Cell Number (Probably a Scam).” Professional. Branded. Slightly seductive.\n\nAnd because we all love receipts: you can **view call history** (including missed calls with voicemail) and return calls with the queue-associated number. Flaky follow-up? Not in this economy.\n\n## Leads: coaching without the “micromanage-y” aftertaste\n\nLeads get the real fun toys—aka, the stuff that makes your team better _without_ turning into a spreadsheet goblin.\n\nYou can **monitor queues and people in real time**, opt agents in/out as needed, and (with the right policy + licensing) use the iconic quartet:\n\n- **Monitor**: listen in quietly.\n- **Whisper**: coach the agent without the caller hearing (the professional version of “pssst, say the thing”).\n- **Barge**: jump in and talk to both sides.\n- **Takeover**: gently remove the agent from the call and handle it yourself.\n\nIt’s like being a call center ninja… but with better UI.\n\n## Analytics: because vibes are not a KPI\n\nThe Queues app includes **real-time stats**—think calls waiting, average wait time, and other “are we okay?” signals—plus **historical reporting** (typically up to the last ~27 days) and the ability to **export to Excel** for the folks who experience joy only when a pivot table snaps into place.\n\n## The spicy new-new: Shared call history (rolling out)\n\nThe upcoming headline feature: **shared call history** for queue members—so the team can see missed, incoming, and outgoing call events in one shared view. It’s rolling out **January–February 2026**, and it’s **disabled by default**, meaning your admin has to enable it. (Yes, you still have to flirt with the Teams Admin Center a little.)\n\n## Tiny but important fine print (aka: consent and licensing)\n\nQueues app is available when users have **Teams Phone + Teams Premium**. Some lead features (like Monitor/Whisper/Barge/Takeover) also depend on **voice applications policy** settings. Platform-wise, it’s primarily for **desktop/Mac/VDI**, and it’s also supported on **Teams phones (touch devices)**.\n\nBottom line: the Queues app takes call queues out of the “everyone panic separately” era and into the “we’re coordinated and slightly smug about it” era. Your customers get faster help. Your agents get calmer days. Your leads get actual levers to pull. And your team gets to keep everything inside Teams—where, frankly, we already live.\n",

      "documentContent": "# Celebrating LoopUp's Microsoft Teams MVP, Zach Bennett\n\nEnterprise voice tends to be the part of collaboration that exposes every compromise. You can roll out chat and meetings quickly, but telephony forces you to deal with geography, regulation, legacy contracts, and user expectations that have been shaped by decades of \"it just works\".\n\nThat is why we are proud to celebrate Zach Bennett, our Microsoft Teams Most Valuable Professional (MVP). Microsoft awards MVP status to a small group of individuals who share deep technical expertise with the community and help others succeed through teaching, content, and real-world guidance.\n\n## Why an MVP matters to global Teams programs\n\nFor enterprise IT teams, Microsoft Teams Phone is rarely a simple switch. It is a program. The moment you introduce the public switched telephone network (PSTN), you inherit questions about number ranges, emergency services, lawful intercept, carrier change processes, and how the experience stays consistent across regions.\n\nAn MVP does not just know the product. They live in the gap between Microsoft documentation and the messy reality of a multinational rollout. Zach's recognition is a signal that his day-to-day work, and the lessons he shares publicly, stand up to scrutiny from practitioners who do this for a living.\n\n## Zach's impact at LoopUp\n\nZach is a Principal Architect at LoopUp, with over a decade in Microsoft unified communications (UC) and voice. He leads Microsoft Teams Phone deployments from strategy and proof of concept through multi-site delivery, supporting organisations as they move away from legacy private branch exchange (PBX) estates.\n\nWhat that looks like in practice is not just design diagrams. It is helping teams choose the right connectivity model, Operator Connect or Direct Routing, and understanding where each fits. It is balancing standardisation with local requirements, building governance that does not slow delivery, and making sure call quality and security are engineered in from the start.\n\n## Community contribution that stays practical\n\nZach's MVP recognition is rooted in how he shows up for the wider community. He writes and produces technical guidance, speaks at industry events, and shares patterns that help other teams avoid costly mistakes. In a recent interview, Zach described his interest in voice technologies and his motivation to teach, not just to solve the immediate problem in front of him, but to improve how others approach the same challenges.\n\nThat mindset matters because Teams Phone is not a one-time migration. Enterprises need a voice strategy that can evolve with business change, mergers, and shifting operating models.\n\n## A well-earned congratulations\n\nZach's achievement is worth celebrating on its own. It also reflects something we value at LoopUp: expertise that is earned in the field, tested in the community, and focused on outcomes.\n\nCongratulations, Zach, and thank you for raising the bar for how we help customers modernise voice on Microsoft Teams.\n",

              "text": "# Instructions to generate marketing material\nThe **aim of this project** is for you to to generate a draft document\ncalled draft.md that contains a blog for LoopUp's Marketing team.\n\nAll changes, tweaks, ammendments, improvemets, and updates to the\ncontent **MUST** be made in the document.\n\nThe approximate length of the final document should be around 500 words.\n\nThe brief provided by the client is contained inside the <brief> tags.\n<brief>\nCelebrate the achievements of our very own Microsoft Teams MVP Zach Bennett.\n</brief>\n\nAfter you have thought about the brief, create a file called brief.md that\ncontains your interpretation of the requirements in your own words to refer\nto when creating or updating the marketing document.\n\n## BEHAVIOUR\nIt's your job to fully understand the brief, if anything is too vague, has\naspects that are not clear, contains ambigious wording that could be taken\ninto different directions, or if you have any suggestions to improve the\nbrief, you **MUST use the question tool** when asking questions or getting\nclarification from the client at any point.\n\nYou **MUST** only ask one question at a time. You **MUST** update the brief.md with\nyour current and evolving understanding of the requirements as the\nconversation progresses. You **MUST NOT** include any style hints or formatting\nreferences in the brief.md file - JUST the content requirements.\n\nIf you do not have any more questions, you should proceed to write the\ndocument.\n\nFinally follow up with a helpful message suggesting that you are open to\nfeedback, or only too happy to clarify your reasoning behind any of it.\n\nThe client will ask you for changes, additions, adjustments, etc. you MUST\nupdate the document as requested until the client is happy.\n\nAlways search the internet for sources of factual information, do not manufacture\nany features or functionality unles specifically asked to. If the brief contains\nany mention of 'recent' or 'latest' you should search online for confirmation\nand up to date information such as news, latest releases, roadmap items, etc.\n\n## HARD RULES\n**Keep these rules in mind when writing the document**\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n## VOICE\n**You are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.**\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n**The document should ideally follow this structure unless told otherwise**\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n## FORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\nUse these hints to guide the document based on what has been asked for.\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**\n- Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria,\n  if not already mentioned already.\n\n## TERMINOLOGY\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n## BEFORE FINALISING\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\n## IMPORTANT\nDo NOT mention these rules or the revision process in draft document.\nDo NOT include follow up questions or any non-content output in the draft document."

During a placement year at General Electric, he realised he preferred a working environment where he could take on diverse responsibilities rather than a conventional large-company structure.\n\n## Professional expertise\n\nZach has over a decade of experience in Microsoft unified-communications (UC) and voice solutions — in particular focusing on telephony and voice integration with collaboration tools. As Principal Architect at LoopUp, he leads global deployments of Microsoft Teams Phone for enterprise clients — from strategic planning and proof-of-concept to multi-site rollouts. He advises organisations on optimising Microsoft licensing, security, and modern workplace capabilities to ensure enterprises can fully leverage Teams and cloud-based telephony.\n\n[![Zach Bennett thought leadership](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2025/12/zach-bennett-thought-leadership.jpg)](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/multinational-businesses-are-struggling-to-breathe-under-the-weight-of-geographically-bound-telephony)\n\n## Thought leadership and community engagement\n\nZach participates actively in the broader technical community: he writes technical blogs, produces educational content, and delivers talks and presentations on voice deployments and modern communications. He was featured in a 2025 interview discussing the future of communication technology, articulating how cloud telephony and integrated communication platforms can transform enterprise communication.\n\n## Philosophy and approach\n\nZach balances technical acumen with a consultative mindset — he prioritises continuous learning, staying abreast of evolving telecom and UC trends, and helping clients navigate migrations from legacy PBX systems to cloud-native solutions. In his own words (from a public interview): “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?” — reflecting his forward-looking view on communication technologies.\n\n> “The telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate … What’s next?”\n\n## Role at LoopUp and impact\n\nAt LoopUp — a global cloud-communications provider offering managed telephony around Microsoft Teams and operating across 100+ countries — Zach ensures enterprises can modernise voice infrastructure with minimal friction.\n\nHis work supports customers in consolidating fragmented telephony systems, reducing cost and complexity, and providing a scalable, secure, and consistent global communication platform.\n\n## Read Zach’s latest posts\n\n#### [Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here](https://loopup.com/en/resource-center/from-our-mvp/redefining-global-communication-the-future-is-already-here/ \"Redefining Global Communication: The Future Is Already Here\")\n\nRemote collaboration is now the norm, but enterprise voice hasn’t kept pace.

Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp, recently spoke with Authority Magazine about where communication technology is heading and how global businesses can stay ahead. As Zach explains, the future isn’t something to prepare for later. It’s already happening.\n\nAt LoopUp, we see this every day. Multinational enterprises are still juggling legacy systems, regional telecom vendors, and fragmented contracts that limit the full value of Microsoft Teams. We help companies replace that complexity with a centralized, cloud-based solution that scales globally.\n\n## One Platform. One Strategy. One Future.\n\nWhile Microsoft Teams has been widely adopted, many companies still rely on outdated telephony setups. The result is technical disconnect, inconsistent user experience, and unnecessary cost. Our approach is different. We deliver a single, enterprise-grade PSTN replacement across more than 100 countries, fully integrated with Teams.\n\nThis isn’t just about modernizing infrastructure. It’s about building a future-ready foundation. That means flexible architecture, regulatory compliance, and a services model that supports long-term transformation.\n\n## Trusted by Multinationals\n\nZach’s advice is rooted in experience: listen carefully, design with intent, and rely on partners who understand the stakes. At LoopUp, we bring deep Microsoft expertise, global reach, and a proven track record.

Even in an era where Teams and other collaboration tools have transformed the way we work, many organizations remain tied to geographically bound telephony systems. These legacy models create complexity, drive up costs, and hold global enterprises back from realizing the full potential of cloud communications.\n\nZach explains that multinationals too often find themselves locked into regional carrier contracts, each with its own billing, service levels, and support structures. What should be a seamless global communications environment becomes fragmented. The result is wasted time, administrative burden, and an inconsistent user experience. For global enterprises with offices spanning continents, this challenge grows exponentially.\n\nThe article points out that multinationals have reached a breaking point. While the modern workplace depends on flexibility and collaboration without borders, the underlying telephony infrastructure is still operating with outdated rules. Employees expect to work from anywhere, customers expect to reach the right person quickly, yet global enterprises are left juggling multiple systems that simply do not align with these realities.\n\nLoopUp’s perspective, shared by Zach, is that the solution lies in simplifying and unifying global telephony. By consolidating services into a single, cloud-based approach, multinationals can eliminate the inefficiencies of regional contracts and gain greater control. Just as importantly, they can ensure that their communications platform evolves in step with their wider digital transformation strategy.\n\nThe piece in NODE Magazine makes clear that global enterprises cannot afford to continue operating with geographically bound systems. The pace of business, the scale of global collaboration, and the need for secure, reliable connections all demand a different approach. As Zach emphasizes, multinationals that take decisive steps now to unify their telephony will position themselves for stronger performance and more resilient operations in the years ahead.\n\n[Click here to read the full story in NODE Magazine](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/multinational-businesses-are-struggling-to-breathe-under-the-weight-of-geographically-bound-telephony?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nAbout LoopUp\n\nLoopUp helps multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage global Microsoft Teams telephony, offering phone numbers and full cloud-based PSTN replacement in more than 100 countries.

Rather than treating the RFP as a purely technical checklist, Zach reframes it as a strategic moment that defines how an organisation will communicate and collaborate across its entire footprint for years to come.\n\nHe highlights why the most successful RFPs begin with outcomes. When enterprises focus first on the global experience they want to deliver, the process becomes far more purposeful. It evolves from reviewing specifications to designing the communication environment that will support long term growth, consistency and operational simplicity.\n\nZach also points to a common challenge. Many multinational organisations still approach telephony country by country, which inevitably recreates fragmentation. His article underscores the importance of choosing a unified global network that removes complexity rather than multiplying it.\n\nThe piece is a thoughtful reminder that the RFP is more than a document. It is the decision point where strategy, capability and global ambition align.

Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n\nT*he telephone totally revolutionized the way we could communicate with people all over the world. But then came email and took it to the next level. And then came text messaging. And then came video calls. And so on…What’s next? What’s just around the corner?*\n\n*In this interview series, called ‘The Future Of Communication Technology’ we are interviewing leaders of tech or telecom companies who are helping to develop emerging communication technologies and the next generation of how we communicate and connect with each other.*\n\n*As a part of this series, I had the pleasure of interviewing Zach Bennett, Principal Architect at LoopUp.*\n\n*Zach Bennett has been immersed in the world of Microsoft technologies since graduating from university 9 years ago, where he had a special focus on voice technologies. Throughout his career, Zach has found joy in sharing his expertise and knowledge with others. Teaching has always been a passion of his, and he is eager to expand his reach and connect with a broader technical community through engaging talks and presentations.*\n\n*Currently, Zach is a Microsoft Teams MVP and Principal Architect at LoopUp, a leading Cloud Telephony provider. At LoopUp, the company specializes in offering PSTN solutions built around Microsoft Teams and is proud to participate in the Operator Connect program. In his day-to-day role, Zach works closely with global organizations, assisting them in transitioning from their outdated PBX systems to Microsoft Teams Phone. Leveraging Operator Connect or Direct Routing via the LoopUp Cloud Telephony Platform, he helps these organizations seamlessly migrate and unlock the full potential of Microsoft Teams for their communication needs.*\n\n**Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started?**\n\nI studied Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, and during my year in industry at General Electric, I realized that the big company life might not be for me. I wanted a workplace that was more intimate, where I could wear many hats and help out wherever possible.\n\nMy interest in Microsoft technologies led me to development work, and eventually, I found my passion in voice deployments with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is where I discovered what I truly love to do, and I’ve been pursuing it ever since.\n\nThe announcement and success of Microsoft Teams opened up a whole new dimension to my career. I delved into the telephony side of Teams, and I enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey led me to LoopUp, where we have a revolutionary approach to Microsoft Teams calling and the technology behind it, which I now help deliver to our customers. Along with this, my continued commitment to community work has offered me the opportunity to join the Microsoft MVP program specialising in Microsoft Teams where I am 1/18 in the UK.\n\n**Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?**\n\nOne of the most interesting and memorable experiences in my career happened when I was invited to talk at CommsVNext in Denver, CO. As a Microsoft Teams MVP, I had the opportunity to present at this prestigious international event, which is dedicated to Microsoft Communications and Collaborations Technologies.\n\nThe event was held at the hotel in downtown Denver, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. I remember preparing extensively for my presentation called “Is Teams ready to be your Contact Center?” where I explored the capabilities of Microsoft Teams in handling complex communication needs and shared insights on maximizing its effectiveness.\n\nWhat made this experience truly special was the sense of community and the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals. The event was well-organized, with all sessions, exhibitors, and food in close proximity, making it easy to engage with attendees and participate in various discussions.\n\nDuring my talk, I shared real-world customer scenarios and solutions, which resonated well with the audience. The feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive, and it was gratifying to see how my insights could help others in their journey with Microsoft Teams.\n\nOverall, CommsVNext in Denver was an unforgettable experience that reinforced my passion for Microsoft technologies and the importance of community engagement. It was a privilege to be part of such a vibrant and knowledgeable group of professionals, and I look forward to future opportunities to share and learn at similar events.\n\n**Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?**\n\n“The Dude abides” The Dude — The Big Lebowski\n\nThis quote is from my favorite film, The Big Lebowski. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and to me it reflects the acceptance of life’s challenges. In the book, “The Dude and the Zen Master”, they talk about Zen principles and how the Dude reflects these throughout the movie and how you can throughout your life. It’s a simple quote that helps me remember whatever is going on through your personal or work life you can survive. Take it in your stride, remember what matters, and also, “The Dude abides”.\n\n**None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?**\n\nFor me that person would be my current colleague and Head of Global Consulting at LoopUp, [Graham Cropley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamcropley/). He is someone I’ve had the pleasure of working with throughout my career across multiple businesses and has allowed me to flourish as a consultant. Graham has been a constant source of knowledge and encouragement towards hitting my career goals.\n\nA story that comes to mind is when Graham and I were working together before LoopUp there was a security workshop that needed to be completed by a couple of consultants, and he thought of me as I’d shown interest. We met up the night before the presentation and I was freaking out as it was my first presentation in front of such a big customer and I didn’t feel like I knew the material well enough. We spent time going through the deck and he said to me “I don’t know this either, let’s work it out”. You don’t have to know everything all the time, but if you’re willing to spend the effort to work it out it goes a long way.\n\n**How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?**\n\nAs a Microsoft Teams MVP, I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time to sharing my expertise with the community. Through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements, I’ve helped others understand and leverage Microsoft Teams and other technologies to improve their workflows and communication.\n\n**Ok wonderful. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview. Can you tell us about the cutting-edge communication tech that you are working on? How do you think that will help people?**\n\nOur cloud telephony solution at [LoopUp](https://loopup.com/us/) aims to transform Microsoft Teams from an internal collaboration tool into a fully-fledged unified communications platform. This allows users to make and receive external phone calls from any Teams-enabled device, providing a seamless and integrated communication experience.\n\n**How do you think this might change the world?**\n\nBy enabling PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, users can stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment.\n\n**Keeping “**[**Black Mirror**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror)**” in mind, can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about?**\n\nWith Black Mirror in mind, having constant contact available via mobile devices and Microsoft Teams could potentially blur the boundaries between work and personal life. It’s important to make sure there is enough education out there about having a healthy work-life balance.\n\n**Was there a “tipping point” that led you to this breakthrough? Can you tell us that story?**\n\nI saw the immense potential of integrating telephony with Teams and it motivated me to pursue this path, join LoopUp and share my knowledge with the community through technical blogs, videos, and speaking engagements. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I’m excited to continue exploring new possibilities in communication technology.\n\n**What do you need to lead this technology to widespread adoption?**\n\nWidespread adoption of Microsoft Teams is already prevalent in my opinion, however, to stay ahead of the competition there still needs to be a steady stream of feature updates that will make Teams telephony more usable across different organizations. At LoopUp we also can increase this widespread adoption due to our increased global coverage of 66 countries and cost-saving capabilities which will make these technologies more accessible.\n\n**The pandemic has changed so many things about the way we behave. One of them of course is how we work and how we communicate in our work. How do you think your innovation might be able to address the new needs that have arisen as a result of the pandemic?**\n\nOur solution enables PSTN calling through Microsoft Teams, allowing users to stay connected from anywhere, whether they’re in the office, working from home, or on the go. This flexibility is crucial in today’s hybrid work environment where employees need to be able to communicate seamlessly regardless of their location. Along with this, moving to a cloud-based telephony system can significantly reduce costs associated with maintaining traditional phone systems. It also offers scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust their communication infrastructure as they grow. This is particularly important in the post-pandemic world, where many organizations are looking to optimize their operations and reduce expenses.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n**What are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started” and why?**\n\n1.  **Embrace Continuous Learning**: Tech evolves rapidly, and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is crucial. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning will help you stay relevant and grow in your career.\n2.  **Networking is Key**: Building a strong professional network can open up many opportunities. Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with peers. These relationships can provide support, advice, and potential career advancements.\n3.  **Don’t Fear Failure**: Failure is a part of the learning process. Each setback is an opportunity to learn and improve.\n4.  **Work-Life Balance Matters**: It’s easy to get consumed by work, especially in a fast-paced industry. Prioritize your well-being and maintain a healthy work-life balance. This will help you stay productive and avoid burnout.\n5.  **Soft Skills are Essential**: Technical skills are important, but soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are equally valuable. These skills will help you collaborate effectively and advance in your career.\n\n**You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)**\n\nOne thing that I believe is very important is supporting lifelong learning by providing resources and platforms for continuous learning and skill development. This would help people stay updated with the latest in technological advancements and make you available to adapt to the changing job market and technology solutions.\n\n**How can our readers further follow your work online?**\n\n**LinkedIn** *—* [https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachjbennett/)\n\n**YouTube** *—* [https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett](https://www.youtube.com/@zachbennett)\n\n**Thank you so much for the time you spent doing this interview.

Give enterprise IT and UC teams a single place to manage telephony globally, with role and location based access, and the ability to move faster without losing control.\n\nSelf-service is not a goal in itself. It changes the trade-offs. You can reduce handoffs and delays, but you still need governance, visibility, and a clear operational model across regions.\n\nIf you are running telephony across multiple geographies, I would be interested to hear what you are optimising for this year: speed of change, consistency and control, or a path off legacy infrastructure without taking unnecessary risk?\n\n\nAI_EDIT_LINE",

              "text": "# Instructions to generate marketing material\nThe **aim of this project** is for you to to generate a draft document\ncalled draft.md that contains a social-post for LoopUp's Marketing team.\n\nAll changes, tweaks, ammendments, improvemets, and updates to the\ncontent **MUST** be made in the document.\n\nThe approximate length of the final document should be around 300 words.\n\nThe brief provided by the client is contained inside the <brief> tags.\n<brief>\nIntroducing LoopUp's brand new self-service SIP trunk provisioning and management tools in LoopUp One (our global management portal)\n</brief>\n\nAfter you have thought about the brief, create a file called brief.md that\ncontains your interpretation of the requirements in your own words to refer\nto when creating or updating the marketing document.\n\n## BEHAVIOUR\nIt's your job to fully understand the brief, if anything is too vague, has\naspects that are not clear, contains ambigious wording that could be taken\ninto different directions, or if you have any suggestions to improve the\nbrief, you **MUST use the question tool** when asking questions or getting\nclarification from the client at any point.\n\nYou **MUST** only ask one question at a time. You **MUST** update the brief.md with\nyour current and evolving understanding of the requirements as the\nconversation progresses. You **MUST NOT** include any style hints or formatting\nreferences in the brief.md file - JUST the content requirements.\n\nIf you do not have any more questions, you should proceed to write the\ndocument.\n\nFinally follow up with a helpful message suggesting that you are open to\nfeedback, or only too happy to clarify your reasoning behind any of it.\n\nThe client will ask you for changes, additions, adjustments, etc. you MUST\nupdate the document as requested until the client is happy.\n\nAlways search the internet for sources of factual information, do not manufacture\nany features or functionality unles specifically asked to. If the brief contains\nany mention of 'recent' or 'latest' you should search online for confirmation\nand up to date information such as news, latest releases, roadmap items, etc.\n\n## HARD RULES\n**Keep these rules in mind when writing the document**\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n## VOICE\n**You are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.**\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n**The document should ideally follow this structure unless told otherwise**\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n## FORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\nUse these hints to guide the document based on what has been asked for.\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**\n- Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria,\n  if not already mentioned already.\n\n## TERMINOLOGY\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n## BEFORE FINALISING\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\n## IMPORTANT\nDo NOT mention these rules or the revision process in draft document.\nDo NOT include follow up questions or any non-content output in the draft document."

For years, multinational IT and UC teams have wrestled with fragmented contracts, patchwork regional vendors, and inconsistent management tools. The operational friction and inefficiencies are real, especially when scale, visibility, and control matter most.\n\nToday, we're proud to announce a new step forward: LoopUp's self-service SIP trunk provisioning and management tools, now available in LoopUp One—our global management portal. This release is about more than just technology; it's about empowering enterprise decision-makers to take charge of their telephony landscape, wherever in the world their teams operate.\n\nWith LoopUp One, you can manage all your global telephony numbers and users in a single place, with role and location-based access. Provision SIP trunks at your own pace, consolidate service provision, and phase your migration to cloud telephony—all without the hassle of multiple contracts, tariffs, or fragmented support. Whether you're maintaining legacy PBXs or planning a full move to Microsoft Teams Phone, LoopUp One gives you the flexibility and control to do it your way.\n\nWe've seen first-hand the productivity gains and operational clarity that come from a unified approach. The trade-offs are clear: less complexity, more transparency, and consistent support across geographies.

We need to push the benefits of LoopUp as a global carrier, such as consolidation of services and vendors into one (LoopUp), very broad global coverage, single pane of glass admin portal, one global network to guarantee voice quality etc, and also play on the benefits of us being an operator connect provider, the certification, setting us above all of the Direct Routing providers that has become a wild-west of cowboy outfits trying to make money from sub-optimal equipment or support services.",

      "documentContent": "# One global carrier for Teams Phone\n\nIf you Microsoft Teams across multiple regions, you probably want Teams Phone to be just as consistent. In reality, global telephony rarely looks like a single system. It looks like a patchwork of regional carriers, uneven contracts, different tariffs, and too many admin tools. When something breaks, you are also coordinating multiple support teams, across multiple time zones.\n\n![Global coverage map for Teams Phone via LoopUp](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/cron/coverage-map-dark.svg)\n\nWe see a second problem when organisations try to solve this with Direct Routing alone. The market is crowded, and not every provider has the engineering discipline, regulatory coverage, or support maturity you need at enterprise scale. Telephony is unforgiving. A small quality issue becomes a daily productivity tax.\n\nLoopUp exists to remove that fragmentation. We help multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage Teams Phone, globally, with one provider.\n\n## What Operator Connect changes\n \nOperator Connect is Microsoft's program that allows certified operators to connect PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services directly into Microsoft Teams Phone. It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.\n\nLoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.\n\n## How LoopUp works in the real world\n\nGlobal Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.\n\nWe bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.\n\nFor many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.\n\n## Why enterprises choose LoopUp\n\nYou can measure this in operational terms:\n\n- One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.\n- One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.\n- One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.\n- One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.\n\nThen there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing. That is how you drive consistent voice quality across regions, instead of leaving it to chance.\n\n## The trade-offs to plan for\n\nTelecommunications is regulated, and not every country allows the same level of PSTN replacement. A serious global program expects this. The practical choice is usually not Operator Connect or Direct Routing. It is choosing where each model makes sense, and keeping operations consistent.\n\n| What you are deciding             | Operator Connect                                                                                 | Direct Routing                                                                                               | LoopUp approach                                                                                                                      |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Who manages the SBC layer         | Your operator manages the SBCs as part of the service (per Microsoft Operator Connect guidance). | You provide and manage a supported SBC that connects to Teams Phone (per Microsoft Direct Routing guidance). | We run Operator Connect where available, and provide Direct Routing as a service where needed, without you running SBCs on premises. |\n| How numbers are assigned          | You connect to the operator and assign numbers in the Teams admin center.                        | Numbers and routing are managed through your SBC and voice routing design.                                   | One service model across countries, with central management in LoopUp One and the right Teams configuration for each region.         |\n| Deployment and day two operations | Faster initial deployment when your operator participates, with operator-managed infrastructure. | More design flexibility, but more infrastructure and operational ownership.                                  | One vendor, one rollout plan, and consistent operations across the mix.                                                              |\n| Support boundaries                | Operator provides support and can escalate to Microsoft through shared channels.                 | Microsoft support is bounded, issues typically start with your SBC vendor and your voice team.               | One support process globally, with clear ownership across Operator Connect and Direct Routing.                                       |\n| Where each tends to fit           | Great when Operator Connect coverage matches your footprint and you want simplicity.             | Useful for specialist integrations and locations where Operator Connect is not the right option.             | Designed for multinationals that want consolidation, and still need breadth across regulated markets.                                |\n\n## Your next step\n\nStop running Teams telephony country by country. Check coverage for your key countries, then we can map the right deployment approach and consolidate your global telephony with one partner, one portal, and one support process.\n",

              "text": "# Instructions to generate marketing material\nThe **aim of this project** is for you to to generate a draft document\ncalled draft.md that contains a landing-page for LoopUp's Marketing team.\n\nAll changes, tweaks, ammendments, improvemets, and updates to the\ncontent **MUST** be made in the document.\n\nThe approximate length of the final document should be around 500 words.\n\nThe brief provided by the client is contained inside the <brief> tags.\n<brief>\nProspective customers that have been looking at the Microsoft Teams Admin Center, browsing the operator connect providers, and luckily stumbled upon LoopUp's listing, they click the link and boom.. they arrive on our website at this landing page. We need to push the benefits of LoopUp as a global carrier, such as consolidation of services and vendors into one (LoopUp), very broad global coverage, single pane of glass admin portal, one global network to guarantee voice quality etc, and also play on the benefits of us being an operator connect provider, the certification, setting us above all of the Direct Routing providers that has become a wild-west of cowboy outfits trying to make money from sub-optimal equipment or support services.\n</brief>\n\nAfter you have thought about the brief, create a file called brief.md that\ncontains your interpretation of the requirements in your own words to refer\nto when creating or updating the marketing document.\n\n## BEHAVIOUR\nIt's your job to fully understand the brief, if anything is too vague, has\naspects that are not clear, contains ambigious wording that could be taken\ninto different directions, or if you have any suggestions to improve the\nbrief, you **MUST use the question tool** when asking questions or getting\nclarification from the client at any point.\n\nYou **MUST** only ask one question at a time. You **MUST** update the brief.md with\nyour current and evolving understanding of the requirements as the\nconversation progresses. You **MUST NOT** include any style hints or formatting\nreferences in the brief.md file - JUST the content requirements.\n\nIf you do not have any more questions, you should proceed to write the\ndocument.\n\nFinally follow up with a helpful message suggesting that you are open to\nfeedback, or only too happy to clarify your reasoning behind any of it.\n\nThe client will ask you for changes, additions, adjustments, etc. you MUST\nupdate the document as requested until the client is happy.\n\nAlways search the internet for sources of factual information, do not manufacture\nany features or functionality unles specifically asked to. If the brief contains\nany mention of 'recent' or 'latest' you should search online for confirmation\nand up to date information such as news, latest releases, roadmap items, etc.\n\n## HARD RULES\n**Keep these rules in mind when writing the document**\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n## VOICE\n**You are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.**\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n**The document should ideally follow this structure unless told otherwise**\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n## FORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\nUse these hints to guide the document based on what has been asked for.\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**\n- Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria,\n  if not already mentioned already.\n\n## TERMINOLOGY\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n## BEFORE FINALISING\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\n## IMPORTANT\nDo NOT mention these rules or the revision process in draft document.\nDo NOT include follow up questions or any non-content output in the draft document."

And in those markets where regulatory issues prevent us from providing PSTN replacement directly, we offer integration with on-premises SBCs and your local carrier to maintain a single consistently-managed Teams Calling implementation, globally.\n\n### Full PSTN replacement for Microsoft Teams Calling\n\n![Licensed service

Integrated with Microsoft Teams. Simple, efficient and premium quality.\n\n[Check coverage](/solutions/cloud-telephony/coverage/)\n\n![LoopUp Operator Connect Map](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/cron/coverage-map-dark.svg)\n\n### Helping multinationals migrate to globally managed telephony integrated with Microsoft Teams\n\nGreat communication is at the heart of all successful businesses, and as a technology leader, you’re constantly seeking new ways to drive quality, simplicity and efficiency into your organisation’s communications choices.\n\nIncreased adoption of video in Microsoft Teams has led to more engagement on team calls for multinationals. One-to-one telephony may no longer dominate everyday communications, but it remains business critical to be reachable via a business phone number, wherever you may be.\n\nAt LoopUp, we believe next generation telephony will be integrated into the dominant Microsoft Teams experience. We also believe there are clear benefits for multinationals to manage telephony globally, as they do Teams. Multiple contracts with multiple regional carriers, multiple administration tools and support processes are the status quo, which is unnecessarily complex, inefficient, and costly.\n\nLoopUp exists to help multinational businesses streamline and simplify next generation telephony, globally. We understand that consolidated vendor supply represents a change from local fragmented purchasing. We have a 20-year heritage providing premium quality voice communications with a high duty of care to some of the world’s most demanding multinationals. We offer regulated and compliant service provision globally, and work with you on your journey into next gen telephony.\n\n![One global provider icon](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2021/04/global-provider-icon-gradient.svg)\n\n#### One global contract\n\n![Global spend optimisation icon gradient](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2021/05/global-spend-optimisation-icon-gradient.svg)\n\n#### One global pricing tariff\n\n![Seamless integration icon gradient](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2021/05/seamless-integration-icon-gradient.svg)\n\n#### One global management portal\n\n![Comprehensive managed service icon gradient](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/2021/05/comprehensive-managed-service-icon-gradient.svg)\n\n#### One global support team\n\n### LoopUp works with multinationals as your global partner for Teams telephony. We pledge:\n\n-   #### Global Coverage\n    \n    A licenced operator in a broad number of countries, with the ability to interconnect carriers in many more.\n-   #### Experience\n    \n    A Microsoft Solutions partner since 2010 and a reputation for providing reliable, secure global voice solutions for over 17 years.\n-   #### Premium audio quality\n    \n    Highest quality routing across 19 best-in-class regional carriers via our private global voice network.\n-   #### Simple deployments\n    \n    Operator Connect, Direct Routing, or an optimised mix of both.\n-   #### Streamlined number provision\n    \n    We take the pain away from number porting, or select from our new number range.\n\n-   #### Centralised management\n    \n    With our best-in-class Global Management Portal with role based access.\n-   #### Accountability\n    \n    A dedicated Account Management team with multi-lingual 24/7 global support.\n-   #### Cost effective\n    \n    Better pricing through consolidated purchasing and GlobalPoolingTM across global billing entities.\n-   #### Integrations\n    \n    Contact center, policy-based call recording, and analytics, all via LoopUp partnerships.\n\n### Our coverage\n\n![](https://loopup.com/app/uploads/cron/coverage-map-dark.svg) \n\n#### Available via Operator Connect\n\nAngola\n\nArgentina\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBolivia\n\nBrazil\n\nBulgaria\n\nCambodia\n\nCanada\n\nChile\n\nColombia\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEcuador\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nGuatemala\n\nHong Kong\n\nHungary\n\nIndonesia\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nKenya\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalaysia\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNicaragua\n\nNorway\n\nPanama\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nRomania\n\nSingapore\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTaiwan\n\nThailand\n\nTurkey\n\nUganda\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nUzbekistan\n\nVietnam\n\n### Find out more by reading The Definitive Guide to Microsoft Teams Operator Connect\n\n[Read Microsoft Teams Operator Connect guide](https://loopup.com/us/microsoft-teams-operator-connect/ \"Learn more\")\n\n## Contact us today\n\nDon’t make your organisation suffer with outdated telephony.

Enterprise IT leaders know the friction: a patchwork of regional carriers, inconsistent contracts, local tariffs, and a tangle of support contacts. Each market brings its own regulatory hurdles, and every acquisition or expansion only adds complexity. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to deliver a consistent, reliable calling experience for users everywhere—without spiraling costs or unpredictable service gaps.\n\nThe move to Microsoft Teams Phone has helped many organizations take a step forward. But the journey isn’t complete if you’re still stitching together services from a roster of Direct Routing providers. The result? More fragmentation, not less. Some providers lack the scale or expertise to deliver true enterprise-grade service, leaving critical business calls vulnerable to poor voice quality or patchy support.\n\nLoopUp set out to change this. As a certified Operator Connect provider for Microsoft Teams, we help multinational organizations consolidate global telephony into one unified solution. No more juggling multiple vendors, contracts, or portals. With LoopUp, you get a single global agreement, transparent pricing, and a management portal that puts every number, user, and location at your fingertips.\n\nOur reach is broad—LoopUp delivers fully compliant PSTN-replacement service in more than 100 countries, with integration options for regions where regulations require a local touch. Our own global voice network leverages 20 top-tier carriers to ensure premium call quality and resilience, wherever your teams work. Everything is managed through LoopUp One: a central admin portal with role and location-based access, designed for enterprise control and visibility.\n\nChoosing Operator Connect through LoopUp isn’t just about technology. It’s about reducing operational risk, simplifying procurement, and gaining a partner with a 20-year heritage in enterprise voice. Unlike the wild-west of Direct Routing, Operator Connect certification means Microsoft has vetted our network, security, and support processes—so you can focus on your business, not your dial tone.\n\nIf you’re ready to consolidate, streamline, and future-proof your Teams telephony, let’s talk.

As a certified Operator Connect provider for Microsoft Teams, we help multinational organizations consolidate global telephony into one unified solution.

Enterprise IT leaders know the friction: a patchwork of regional carriers, inconsistent contracts, local tariffs, and a tangle of support contacts. Each market brings its own regulatory hurdles, and every acquisition or expansion only adds complexity. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to deliver a consistent, reliable calling experience for users everywhere, without spiraling costs or unpredictable service gaps.\n\nThe move to Microsoft Teams Phone has helped many organizations take a step forward. But the journey isn’t complete if you’re still stitching together services from a roster of Direct Routing providers. The result? More fragmentation, not less. Some providers lack the scale or expertise to deliver true enterprise-grade service, leaving critical business calls vulnerable to poor voice quality or patchy support.\n\nLoopUp set out to change this. As a certified Operator Connect provider for Microsoft Teams, we help multinational organizations consolidate global telephony into one unified solution. No more juggling multiple vendors, contracts, or portals. With LoopUp, you get a single global agreement, transparent pricing, and a management portal that puts every number, user, and location at your fingertips.\n\nOur reach is broad.

Enterprise IT leaders know the friction: a patchwork of regional carriers, inconsistent contracts, local tariffs, and a tangle of support contacts. Each market brings its own regulatory hurdles, and every acquisition or expansion only adds complexity. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to deliver a consistent, reliable calling experience for users everywhere, without spiraling costs or unpredictable service gaps.\n-\n-The move to Microsoft Teams Phone has helped many organizations take a step forward. But the journey isn’t complete if you’re still stitching together services from a roster of Direct Routing providers. The result? More fragmentation, not less. Some providers lack the scale or expertise to deliver true enterprise-grade service, leaving critical business calls vulnerable to poor voice quality or patchy support.\n-\n-LoopUp set out to change this. As a certified Operator Connect provider for Microsoft Teams, we help multinational organizations consolidate global telephony into one unified solution. No more juggling multiple vendors, contracts, or portals. With LoopUp, you get a single global agreement, transparent pricing, and a management portal that puts every number, user, and location at your fingertips.\n-\n-Our reach is broad. LoopUp delivers fully compliant PSTN-replacement service in more than 100 countries, with integration options for regions where regulations require a local touch. Our own global voice network leverages 20 top-tier carriers to ensure premium call quality and resilience, wherever your teams work. Everything is managed through LoopUp One: a central admin portal with role and location-based access, designed for enterprise control and visibility. In practice, it means fewer moving parts and more control.\n-\n-Choosing Operator Connect through LoopUp isn’t just about technology. It’s about reducing operational risk, simplifying procurement, and gaining a partner with a 20-year heritage in enterprise voice.

In reality, global telephony rarely looks like a single system. It looks like a patchwork of regional carriers, uneven contracts, different tariffs, and too many admin tools. When something breaks, you are also coordinating multiple support teams, across multiple time zones.\n00004| \n00005| We see a second problem when organisations try to solve this with Direct Routing alone. The market is crowded, and not every provider has the engineering discipline, regulatory coverage, or support maturity you need at enterprise scale. Telephony is unforgiving. A small quality issue becomes a daily productivity tax.\n00006| \n00007| LoopUp exists to remove that fragmentation. We help multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage Teams Phone, globally, with one provider.\n00008| \n00009| ## What Operator Connect changes\n00010| \n00011| Operator Connect is Microsoft's program that allows certified operators to connect PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services directly into Microsoft Teams Phone. It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.\n00012| \n00013| LoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.\n00014| \n00015| ## How LoopUp works in the real world\n00016| \n00017| Global Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.\n00018| \n00019| We bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.\n00020| \n00021| For many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.\n00022| \n00023| ## Why enterprises choose LoopUp\n00024| \n00025| You can measure this in operational terms:\n00026| \n00027| - One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.\n00028| - One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.\n00029| - One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.\n00030| - One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.\n00031| \n00032| Then there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing. That is how you drive consistent voice quality across regions, instead of leaving it to chance.\n00033| \n00034| ## The trade-offs to plan for\n00035| \n00036| Telecommunications is regulated, and not every country allows the same level of PSTN replacement. A serious global program expects this. We design the right mix of Operator Connect and Direct Routing, and can also support Bring your own Carrier for countries outside our coverage, while keeping central management consistent.\n00037| \n00038| ## Your next step\n00039| \n00040| Stop running Teams telephony country by country. Check coverage for your key countries, then we can map the right deployment approach and consolidate your global telephony with one partner, one portal, and one support process.\n00041| \n\n(End of file - total 41 lines)\n</file>",

For more information about Teams voice solutions and PSTN connectivity options, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](cloud-voice-landing-page) and [PSTN connectivity options](pstn-connectivity).\n\nThis article describes benefits and requirements, and provides a link to the operators participating in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program.\n\nOperator Connect might be the right solution for your organization if:\n\n-   Microsoft Calling Plan isn't available in your geographic location.\n    \n-   Your preferred operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program.\n    \n-   You want to find a new operator to enable calling in Teams.\n    \n\nIf you decide Operator Connect is the right solution for your organization, after reading this article, see [Configure Operator Connect](operator-connect-configure).\n\n## Benefits\n\nWith Operator Connect, if your existing operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program, they can manage the service for bringing PSTN calling to Teams. The Operator Connect program provides the following benefits:\n\n-   **Leverage existing contracts, or find a new operator.** You keep your preferred operator and contracts, or choose a new one from a selection of participating operators to meet your business needs.\n    \n-   **Operator-managed infrastructure.** Your operator manages the PSTN calling services and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), allowing you to save on hardware purchase and management.\n    \n-   **Faster, easier deployment.** You can quickly connect to your operator and assign phone numbers to users -– all from the Teams admin center.\n    \n-   **Enhanced support and reliability.** Operators provide technical support and shared service level agreements to improve support service, while direct peering powered by Azure creates a one-to-one network connection for enhanced reliability.\n    \n\n## Requirements\n\nTo enable phone number assignments with Operator Connect, make sure your users are:\n\n-   Teams Phone licensed. To learn more, see [What is Phone System?](what-is-phone-system-in-office-365) and [Assign Teams add-on licenses to users](teams-add-on-licensing/assign-teams-add-on-licenses).\n-   In TeamsOnly mode. The user needs to be in TeamsOnly mode, but your entire organization doesn't. To learn more, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability).\n\nFor a list of operators participating in the Microsoft Operator Connect Program and the countries or regions where their service is available, see the [Microsoft 365 Operator Connect directory](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/microsoft-365-for-operators/directory).\n\n## Support boundaries\n\nFor technical support, contact the customer support of your Operator Connect Operator first. If needed, Operator Connect Operators can escalate your support case directly to Microsoft engineering through shared support channels.\n\n## Related articles\n\n-   [Configure Operator Connect](operator-connect-configure)\n\n---\n\n## Feedback\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No No\n\nNeed help with this topic?\n\nWant to try using Ask Learn to clarify or guide you through this topic?\n\nAsk Learn Ask Learn\n\nSuggest a fix?\n\n---\n\n## Additional resources\n\n---\n\n-   Last updated on 2025-04-01\n\n### In this article\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No No\n\nNeed help with this topic?\n\nWant to try using Ask Learn to clarify or guide you through this topic?\n\nAsk Learn Ask Learn\n\nSuggest a fix?\n\n[en-us](#)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices](https://aka.ms/yourcaliforniaprivacychoices)\n\nTheme\n\n-   Light\n-   Dark\n-   High contrast\n\n-   [AI Disclaimer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/principles-for-ai-generated-content)\n-   [Previous Versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/)\n-   [Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftLearnBlog)\n-   [Contribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute)\n-   [Privacy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)\n-   [Terms of Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/termsofuse)\n-   [Trademarks](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/Trademarks/)\n-   © Microsoft 2026",

With this capability, you can configure on-premises Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with Teams, as shown in the following diagram:\n\n![Diagram showing configuration of on-premises PSTN connectivity.](media/plandirectrouting1-pstnwithteams.png \"Configuration of on-premises PSTN connectivity with Microsoft Teams\")\n\nPlanning your deployment of Direct Routing is key to a successful implementation. This article describes infrastructure and licensing requirements, and provides information about SBC connectivity. Be sure to read this article before you start your configuration, which is described in [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure).\n\nWith Direct Routing, you can connect your SBC to almost any telephony trunk or interconnect with third-party PSTN equipment. Direct Routing enables you to:\n\n-   Use virtually any PSTN trunk with Teams Phone.\n    \n-   Configure interoperability between customer-owned telephony equipment, such as a third-party private branch exchange (PBX), analog devices, and Teams.\n    \n\nMicrosoft also offers all-in-the-cloud voice solutions, such as Microsoft Calling Plan. However, Direct Routing might be best for your organization if:\n\n-   Microsoft Calling Plan isn't available in your country/region.\n    \n-   Your organization requires connection to third-party analog devices, call centers, and so on.\n    \n-   Your organization has an existing contract with a PSTN carrier.\n    \n\nFor more information about voice solutions, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](cloud-voice-landing-page).\n\nWith Direct Routing, when users participate in a scheduled meeting, the dial-in number is provided by the Microsoft Audio Conferencing service, which requires proper licensing. When dialing out, Audio Conferencing places the call using online calling capabilities, which requires proper licensing. If a user doesn't have a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license, the call routes through Direct Routing. For more information, see [Direct Routing with Audio Conferencing](#direct-routing-with-audio-conferencing).\n\nDirect Routing also supports users who have another license for Microsoft Calling Plan. For more information, see [Direct Routing with Calling Plan and Operator Connect](#direct-routing-with-calling-plans-and-operator-connect).\n\n## Infrastructure requirements\n\nThe infrastructure requirements for the supported SBCs, domains, and other network connectivity requirements to deploy Direct Routing are listed in the following table:\n\nInfrastructure requirement\n\nYou need the following\n\nSession Border Controller (SBC)\n\nA supported SBC. For more information, see [Supported SBCs](#supported-session-border-controllers-sbcs).\n\nTelephony trunks connected to the SBC\n\nOne or more telephony trunks connected to the SBC. On one end, the SBC connects to Teams Phone through Direct Routing. The SBC can also connect to third-party telephony entities, such as PBXs, Analog Telephony Adapters, and so on. Any PSTN connectivity option connected to the SBC will work. (For configuration of the PSTN trunks to the SBC, refer to the SBC vendors or trunk providers.)\n\nMicrosoft 365 organization\n\nA Microsoft 365 organization that you use to home your Microsoft Teams users, and the configuration and connection to the SBC.\n\nUser registrar\n\nUser must be homed in Microsoft 365.  \nIf your company has an on-premises Skype for Business environment with hybrid connectivity to Microsoft 365, you can't enable voice in Teams for a user homed on-premises.  \n  \nTo check the registrar of a user, use the following Teams PowerShell cmdlet:  \n`Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity <user> | fl HostingProvider`  \n  \nThe output of the cmdlet should show:  \n`HostingProvider : sipfed.online.lync.com`\n\nDomains\n\nOne or more domains added to your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organizations.  \n  \nYou can't use the default domain, \\*.onmicrosoft.com, which is automatically created for your tenant.  \n  \nTo view the domains, you can use the following Teams PowerShell cmdlet:  \n`Get-CsTenant | fl Domains`  \n  \nFor more information about domains and Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organizations, see [Domains FAQ](https://support.office.com/article/Domains-FAQ-1272bad0-4bd4-4796-8005-67d6fb3afc5a).\n\nPublic IP address for the SBC\n\nA public IP address that can be used to connect to the SBC. Based on the type of SBC, the SBC can use NAT.\n\nFully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the SBC\n\nAn FQDN for the SBC, where the domain portion of the FQDN is one of the registered domains in your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization. For more information, see [SBC domain names](#sbc-domain-names).\n\nPublic DNS entry for the SBC\n\nA public DNS entry mapping the SBC FQDN to the public IP Address.\n\nPublic trusted certificate for the SBC\n\nA certificate for the SBC to be used for all communication with Direct Routing. For more information, see [Public trusted certificate for the SBC](#public-trusted-certificate-for-the-sbc).\n\nConnection points for Direct Routing\n\nThe connection points for Direct Routing are the following three FQDNs:  \n  \n`sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com` – Global FQDN, must be tried first.  \n`sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com` – Secondary FQDN, geographically maps to the second priority region.  \n`sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com` – Tertiary FQDN, geographically maps to the third priority region.  \n  \nFor information on configuration requirements, see [SIP Signaling: FQDNs](#sip-signaling-fqdns).\n\nFirewall IP addresses and ports for Direct Routing media\n\nThe SBC communicates to the following services in the cloud:  \n  \n\\- SIP Proxy, which handles the signaling  \n\\- Media Processor, which handles media -except when Media Bypass is on  \n  \nThese two services have separate IP addresses in Microsoft Cloud, described later in this document.  \n  \nFor more information, see the [Microsoft Teams section](/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams) in [URLs and IP address ranges](/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges).\n\nMedia Transport Profile\n\nTCP/RTP/SAVP  \nUDP/RTP/SAVP\n\n## Licensing and other requirements\n\nDirect Routing users must have the following licenses assigned in Microsoft 365:\n\n-   Teams Phone\n-   Microsoft Teams\n\nFor information about when an Audio Conferencing license is required, see [Direct Routing with Audio Conferencing](#direct-routing-with-audio-conferencing).\n\nDirect Routing also supports users who are licensed for Microsoft Calling Plan. For more information, see [Direct Routing with Calling Plan and Operator Connect](#direct-routing-with-calling-plans-and-operator-connect).\n\nFor more information about licensing, see [Microsoft Teams licensing](user-access) and [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).\n\nNote: Direct Routing isn't supported in Islands mode.\n\n### Direct Routing with Audio Conferencing\n\nThis section describes requirements and considerations when using Direct Routing and Audio Conferencing.\n\n-   **For GCC High and DoD G5 users**, Microsoft recommends that you disable the Audio Conferencing component included in G5 until you configure Direct Routing, and you've added Audio Conferencing numbers to your organization's tenant.\n    \n-   **For GCC High and DoD G3 users**, Microsoft recommends that you don't assign the Audio Conferencing license add-on until you configure Direct Routing, and you've added Audio Conferencing numbers to your organization's tenant.\n    \n\nFor more information, see [Audio Conferencing with Direct Routing for GCC High and DoD](audio-conferencing-with-direct-routing-for-gcch-and-dod).\n\n#### Unplanned call escalation and Audio Conferencing license\n\nA Teams user can start a one-on-one Teams-to-PSTN or Teams-to-Teams call and add a PSTN participant to it. The path that the call takes depends on whether the user who escalates the call has a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned or not:\n\n-   **If the Teams user who escalates the call has a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned**, the escalation happens through the Microsoft Audio Conferencing service. The remote PSTN participant who is invited to the existing call receives a notification about the incoming call, and sees the number of the Microsoft bridge assigned to the Teams user who initiated the escalation.\n    \n-   **If the Teams user who escalates the call doesn't have the Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned**, the escalation happens through a Session Border Controller connected to the Direct Routing interface. The remote PSTN participant who is invited to the call receives a notification about the incoming call and sees the number of the Teams user who initiated the escalation. The specific SBC used for the escalation is defined by the routing policy of the user.\n    \n\nYou must ensure the following:\n\n-   CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy is assigned to the user.\n    \n-   Allow Private Calling is enabled at the tenant level for Microsoft Teams.\n    \n\n### Direct Routing with Calling Plans and Operator Connect\n\nDirect Routing also supports users who are licensed for Microsoft Calling Plan or assigned an Operator Connect phone number. Teams Phone with Calling Plan or Operator Connect enabled users can route some calls using the Direct Routing interface.\n\nMixing Calling Plan or Operator Connect and Direct Routing connectivity for the same user is optional, but could be useful. For example, when the user is assigned a Microsoft Calling Plan or Operator Connect number but wants to route some calls using the SBC.\n\nOne of the most common scenarios is calls to third-party PBXs. With this configuration, calls to the phones connected to the third-party PBX are routed using Direct Routing and therefore stay within the enterprise network, not traversing the PSTN. Meanwhile, all other calls are routed to the PSTN based on the users’ assigned PSTN connectivity method: Microsoft Calling Plan or Operator Connect.\n\nFor more information about Teams Phone licensing, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).\n\n## Supported end points\n\nYou can use the following as an end point:\n\n-   Any Teams client.\n    \n-   Common area phones. You don't need a Calling Plan license when setting up a common area phone with Direct Routing. For more information, see [Set up common area phones for Microsoft Teams](set-up-common-area-phones).\n    \n\n## SBC domain names\n\nThe SBC domain name must be from one of the names registered in Domains of the tenant.\n\nThe following table shows examples of DNS names registered for the tenant, whether the name can be used as an FQDN for the SBC, and examples of valid FQDN names. Note that you can't use the \\*.onmicrosoft.com tenant for the FQDN name of the SBC.\n\nDNS name\n\nCan be used for SBC FQDN\n\nExamples of FQDN names\n\ncontoso.com\n\nYes\n\n**Valid names:**  \nsbc1.contoso.com  \nssbcs15.contoso.com  \neurope.contoso.com\n\ncontoso.onmicrosoft.com\n\nNo\n\nUsing \\*.onmicrosoft.com domains isn't supported for SBC names\n\nAssume you want to use a new domain name. For example, your tenant has contoso.com as a domain name registered in your tenant, and you want to use sbc1.sip.contoso.com.\n\nBefore you can pair an SBC with the name sbc1.sip.contoso.com, you must register the domain name sip.contoso.com in Domains in your tenant. If you try pairing an SBC with sbc1.sip.contoso.com before registering the domain name, you'll get the following error: \"Can't use the \"sbc1.sip.contoso.com\" domain as it wasn't configured for this tenant.\"\n\nAfter you add the domain name, you need to create a user with UPN user@sip.contoso.com and assign a Teams license. It may take up to 24 hours to fully provision the domain name after it's added to Domains of your tenant, to create a user with a new name, and to assign a license to the user.\n\nIt's possible that a company might have several SIP address spaces in one tenant. For example, a company might have contoso.com as a SIP address space and fabrikam.com as the second SIP address space. Some users have address user@contoso.com and some users have address user@fabrikam.com.\n\nThe SBC only needs one FQDN and can service users from any address space in the paired tenant. For example, an SBC with the name sbc1.contoso.com can receive and send the PSTN traffic for users with addresses user@contoso.com and user@fabrikam.com as long as these SIP address spaces are registered in the same tenant.\n\nNote\n\nSBC FQDN in Azure Communication Services direct routing must be different from SBC FQDN in Teams Direct Routing.\n\n## Public trusted certificate for the SBC\n\nMicrosoft recommends that you request the certificate for the SBC by generating a certification signing request (CSR). For specific instructions on generating a CSR for an SBC, see the interconnection instructions or documentation provided by your SBC vendors.\n\nNote\n\nMost Certificate Authorities (CAs) require the private key size to be at least 2048. Keep this in mind when generating the CSR.\n\nThe certificate needs to have the SBC FQDN as the common name (CN) or the subject alternative name (SAN) field.\n\nAlternatively, Direct Routing supports a wildcard in the CN and/or SAN, and the wildcard needs to conform to standard [RFC HTTP Over TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1).\n\nAn example would be using \\*.contoso.com, which would match the SBC FQDN sbc.contoso.com, but wouldn't match with sbc.test.contoso.com.\n\nDirect Routing SIP interface will only trust certificates that are signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are part of the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program. Make sure that a CA that is part of the program signs your SBC certificate. Also make sure that the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of your certificate includes Server Authentication.\n\nFor more information, see [Program Requirements - Microsoft Trusted Root Program](/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements).\n\nFor Direct Routing in Office 365 GCCH and DoD environments, one of the following root certificate authorities needs to generate the certificate:\n\n-   DigiCert Global Root CA\n-   DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA\n\nNote\n\nIf Mutual TLS (MTLS) support is enabled for the Teams connection on the SBC, then you must install all the CAs listed under the 'Root Certificate Authorities' section in Azure Certificate Authority details page in the SBC Trusted Root Store of the Teams TLS context. (This is because the Microsoft service certificates use these root certificates.)  To download the root certificates, see [Microsoft 365 Encryption chains](/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption-office-365-certificate-chains). For more information, see [Office TLS Certificate Changes](/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption-office-365-tls-certificates-changes).\n\nTo verify that the MTLS connection originates from Teams infrastructure, the SBC should be configured to implement the following checks on the Teams server-side certificate:\n\n-   Check that the certificate issuance chain originates from one of the root CAs listed under the 'Root Certificate Authorities' section in Azure Certificate Authority [details page.](/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-ca-details?tabs=root-and-subordinate-cas-list)\n    \n-   Check that the certificate \"Subject Alternative Name\" includes \"sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com\".\n    \n\n## SIP signaling: FQDNs, ports, failover mechanism\n\nDirect Routing is offered in the following environments:\n\n-   Microsoft 365 or Office 365\n-   Office 365 GCC\n-   Office 365 GCC High\n-   Office 365 DoD\n\nFor more information about government environments, such as GCC, GCC High, and DoD, see [Office 365 and US Government environments](/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government).\n\nThe following sections describe information about FQDNs, ports, and failover mechanisms.\n\n### SIP signaling: FQDNs\n\nThe following sections describe the FQDN connection points for various Microsoft cloud environments.\n\n#### Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Office 365 GCC environments\n\nIn these environments, the connection points for Direct Routing are the following three FQDNs:\n\n-   **sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Global FQDN – must be tried first. When the SBC sends a request to resolve this name, the Microsoft Azure DNS servers return an IP address pointing to the primary Azure datacenter assigned to the SBC. The assignment is based on performance metrics of the datacenters and geographical proximity to the SBC. The IP address returned corresponds to the primary FQDN.\n    \n-   **sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Secondary FQDN – geographically maps to the second priority region.\n    \n-   **sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Tertiary FQDN – geographically maps to the third priority region.\n    \n\nPlacing these three FQDNs in order is required to:\n\n-   Provide optimal experience (less loaded and closest to the SBC datacenter assigned by querying the first FQDN).\n    \n-   Provide failover when connection from an SBC is established to a datacenter that is experiencing a temporary issue. For more information, see [Failover mechanism](#sip-signaling-failover-mechanism).\n    \n\nThe FQDNs sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com, sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com, and sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com are resolved to IP addresses from the following subnets:\n\n-   52.112.0.0/14\n-   52.120.0.0/14\n\nYou need to open ports for all these IP address ranges in your firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling.\n\nNote: Inbound SIP traffic to the SBCs from Teams SIP endpoints can originate from any IPs in these subnets--not only from IPs that resolve from the previously mentioned FQDNs. For more information on how to set up SIP peering, see your SBC documentation.\n\n#### Office GCC DoD environment\n\nIn the Office GCC DoD environment, the connection point for Direct Routing is the following FQDN:\n\n**sip.pstnhub.dod.teams.microsoft.us** – Global FQDN. As the Office 365 DoD environment exists only in the US data centers, there's no secondary and tertiary FQDNs.\n\nThe FQDN sip.pstnhub.dod.teams.microsoft.us is resolved to an IP address from the following subnet: 52.127.64.0/21\n\nTo allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling, you need to open ports for all these IP addresses in your firewall.\n\n#### Office 365 GCC High environment\n\nIn the Office 365 GCC High environment, the connection point for Direct Routing is the following FQDN:\n\n**sip.pstnhub.gov.teams.microsoft.us** – Global FQDN. As the GCC High environment exists only in the US data centers, there's no secondary and tertiary FQDNs.\n\nThe FQDN sip.pstnhub.gov.teams.microsoft.us is resolved to an IP address from the following subnet: 52.127.88.0/21\n\nTo allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling, you need to open ports for all these IP addresses in your firewall.\n\n### SIP signaling: Ports\n\nYou must use the following ports for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 environments where Direct Routing is offered:\n\nTraffic\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nSource port\n\nDestination port\n\nSIP/TLS\n\nSIP Proxy\n\nSBC\n\n1024 – 65535\n\nDefined on the SBC (For Office 365 GCC High/DoD only port 5061 must be used)\n\nSIP/TLS\n\nSBC\n\nSIP Proxy\n\nDefined on the SBC\n\n5061\n\n### SIP signaling: Failover mechanism\n\nTo resolve sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com, the SBC makes a DNS query. Based on the SBC location and the datacenter performance metrics, the primary datacenter is selected.\n\nIf the primary datacenter experiences an issue, the SBC tries sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com, which resolves to the second assigned datacenter. In the rare case that datacenters in two regions aren't available, the SBC retries the last FQDN (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com), which provides the tertiary datacenter IP.\n\nThe following table summarizes the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary datacenters:\n\nIf the primary datacenter is\n\nEMEA\n\nNOAM\n\nASIA\n\nThe secondary datacenter (sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com)\n\nUS\n\nEU\n\nUS\n\nThe tertiary datacenter (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com)\n\nASIA\n\nASIA\n\nEU\n\n## Media traffic: port ranges, media processors, CODECS\n\n### Media traffic: port ranges\n\nIf you want to deploy Direct Routing without media bypass, the following requirements apply. For firewall requirements for media bypass, see [Plan for media bypass with Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan-media-bypass).\n\nThe media traffic flows to and from a separate service in the Microsoft Cloud. The IP address ranges for media traffic are as follows.\n\nNote\n\nIP ranges presented in this document are specific to Direct Routing and may differ from the ones advised for Teams client.\n\n#### Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Office 365 GCC environments\n\nIn the Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Office 365 GCC environments, the IP address ranges are:\n\n-   52.112.0.0/14 (IP addresses from 52.112.0.0 to 52.115.255.255)\n-   52.120.0.0/14 (IP addresses from 52.120.0.0 to 52.123.255.255)\n\n#### Office 365 DoD environment\n\nIn the Office 365 DoD environment, the IP address ranges are:\n\n-   52.127.64.0/21\n\n#### Office 365 GCC High environment\n\nIn the Office 365 GCC High environment, the IP address ranges are:\n\n-   52.127.88.0/21\n\n#### All environments\n\nThe port ranges of the media processors are shown in the following table:\n\nTraffic\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nSource port\n\nDestination port\n\nUDP/SRTP\n\nMedia Processor\n\nSBC\n\n3478-3481 and 49152 – 53247\n\nDefined on the SBC\n\nUDP/SRTP\n\nSBC\n\nMedia Processor\n\nDefined on the SBC\n\n3478-3481 and 49152 – 53247\n\nNote\n\nMicrosoft recommends at least two ports per concurrent call on the SBC.\n\n### Media traffic: processors geography\n\nMedia traffic flows through components called media processors. Media processors are placed in the same datacenters as SIP proxies as follows:\n\n-   NOAM (US South Central, two in US West and US East datacenters)\n-   Europe (UK South, France Central, Amsterdam, and Dublin datacenters)\n-   Asia (Singapore datacenter)\n-   Japan (JP East and West datacenters)\n-   Australia (AU East and Southeast datacenters)\n-   LATAM (Brazil South)\n\n### Media traffic: Codecs\n\nThe following sections describe the codecs for media traffic.\n\n### Leg between SBC and Cloud Media Processor or Microsoft Teams client\n\nApplies to both media bypass case and non-bypass cases.\n\nThe Direct Routing interface on the leg between the Session Border Controller and Cloud Media Processor (without media bypass) or between the Teams client and the SBC (if media bypass is enabled) can use the following codecs:\n\n-   Non-Media bypass (SBC to Cloud media processor): SILK, G.711, G.722, G.729\n-   Media bypass (SBC to Teams client): SILK, G.711, G.722, G.729\n\nYou can force use of the specific codec on the Session Border Controller by excluding undesirable codecs from the offer.\n\n### Leg between Microsoft Teams client and Cloud media processor\n\nApplies to non-media bypass case only. With media bypass, the media flows directly between the Teams client and the SBC.\n\nOn the leg between the Cloud media processor and the Teams client, either SILK or G.722 is used. The codec choice on this leg is based on Microsoft algorithms, which take into consideration multiple parameters.\n\nNote\n\nMedia re-targeting isn't supported. During a call, if Direct Routing SBC SIP re-Invite (Offer) contains a new media IP address, port, or transport, media isn't sent from PSTN Hub to the new target. Per RFC 3264 8.3.1, media re-target support is optional (not required).\n\n## Supported Session Border Controllers (SBCs)\n\nMicrosoft only supports certified SBCs to pair with Direct Routing. Because Enterprise Voice is critical for businesses, Microsoft runs intensive tests with the selected SBCs, and works with the SBC vendors to ensure the two systems are compatible.\n\nDevices that are validated are listed as Certified for Teams Direct Routing. The certified devices are guaranteed to work in all scenarios.\n\nFor more information about supported SBCs, see [Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing](direct-routing-border-controllers).\n\n## Support boundaries\n\nMicrosoft only supports Teams Phone with Direct Routing when used with certified devices. If there are issues, you must contact your SBC vendor's customer support first. If needed, the SBC vendor escalates the issue to Microsoft through internal channels.\n\nTo escalate SBC related issues to Microsoft support, customers must present an SBC vendor investigation report. This document, containing the vendor's ticket reference number, will be supplied by their certified SBC vendor.\n\nMicrosoft reserves the right to reject support cases where a non-certified device is connected to Teams Phone through Direct Routing. If Microsoft determines that a customer's Direct Routing issue is with a vendor's SBC device, the customer needs to re-engage the SBC vendor for support.\n\n## See also\n\n-   [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure)\n    \n-   Video session: [Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/teams-direct-routing).\n    \n\n---\n\n## Feedback\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No No\n\nNeed help with this topic?\n\nWant to try using Ask Learn to clarify or guide you through this topic?\n\nAsk Learn Ask Learn\n\nSuggest a fix?\n\n---\n\n## Additional resources\n\n---\n\n-   Last updated on 2025-05-06\n\n### In this article\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No No\n\nNeed help with this topic?\n\nWant to try using Ask Learn to clarify or guide you through this topic?\n\nAsk Learn Ask Learn\n\nSuggest a fix?\n\n[en-us](#)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices](https://aka.ms/yourcaliforniaprivacychoices)\n\nTheme\n\n-   Light\n-   Dark\n-   High contrast\n\n-   [AI Disclaimer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/principles-for-ai-generated-content)\n-   [Previous Versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/)\n-   [Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftLearnBlog)\n-   [Contribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute)\n-   [Privacy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)\n-   [Terms of Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/termsofuse)\n-   [Trademarks](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/Trademarks/)\n-   © Microsoft 2026",

                      "before": "# One global carrier for Teams Phone\n\nIf you run Microsoft Teams across multiple regions, you probably want Teams Phone to be just as consistent. In reality, global telephony rarely looks like a single system. It looks like a patchwork of regional carriers, uneven contracts, different tariffs, and too many admin tools. When something breaks, you are also coordinating multiple support teams, across multiple time zones.\n\nWe see a second problem when organisations try to solve this with Direct Routing alone. The market is crowded, and not every provider has the engineering discipline, regulatory coverage, or support maturity you need at enterprise scale. Telephony is unforgiving. A small quality issue becomes a daily productivity tax.\n\nLoopUp exists to remove that fragmentation. We help multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage Teams Phone, globally, with one provider.\n\n## What Operator Connect changes\n\nOperator Connect is Microsoft's program that allows certified operators to connect PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services directly into Microsoft Teams Phone. It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.\n\nLoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.\n\n## How LoopUp works in the real world\n\nGlobal Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.\n\nWe bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.\n\nFor many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.\n\n## Why enterprises choose LoopUp\n\nYou can measure this in operational terms:\n\n- One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.\n- One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.\n- One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.\n- One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.\n\nThen there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing.

In reality, global telephony rarely looks like a single system. It looks like a patchwork of regional carriers, uneven contracts, different tariffs, and too many admin tools. When something breaks, you are also coordinating multiple support teams, across multiple time zones.\n00004| \n00005| We see a second problem when organisations try to solve this with Direct Routing alone. The market is crowded, and not every provider has the engineering discipline, regulatory coverage, or support maturity you need at enterprise scale. Telephony is unforgiving. A small quality issue becomes a daily productivity tax.\n00006| \n00007| LoopUp exists to remove that fragmentation. We help multinational enterprises consolidate how they buy and manage Teams Phone, globally, with one provider.\n00008| \n00009| ## What Operator Connect changes\n00010| \n00011| Operator Connect is Microsoft's program that allows certified operators to connect PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services directly into Microsoft Teams Phone. It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.\n00012| \n00013| LoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.\n00014| \n00015| ## How LoopUp works in the real world\n00016| \n00017| Global Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.\n00018| \n00019| We bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.\n00020| \n00021| For many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.\n00022| \n00023| ## Why enterprises choose LoopUp\n00024| \n00025| You can measure this in operational terms:\n00026| \n00027| - One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.\n00028| - One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.\n00029| - One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.\n00030| - One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.\n00031| \n00032| Then there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing. That is how you drive consistent voice quality across regions, instead of leaving it to chance.\n00033| \n00034| ## The trade-offs to plan for\n00035| \n00036| Telecommunications is regulated, and not every country allows the same level of PSTN replacement. A serious global program expects this. The practical choice is usually not Operator Connect or Direct Routing. It is choosing where each model makes sense, and keeping operations consistent.\n00037| \n00038| | What you are deciding             | Operator Connect                                                                                 | Direct Routing                                                                                               | LoopUp approach                                                                                                                      |\n00039| | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n00040| | Who manages the SBC layer         | Your operator manages the SBCs as part of the service (per Microsoft Operator Connect guidance). | You provide and manage a supported SBC that connects to Teams Phone (per Microsoft Direct Routing guidance). | We run Operator Connect where available, and provide Direct Routing as a service where needed, without you running SBCs on premises. |\n00041| | How numbers are assigned          | You connect to the operator and assign numbers in the Teams admin center.                        | Numbers and routing are managed through your SBC and voice routing design.                                   | One service model across countries, with central management in LoopUp One and the right Teams configuration for each region.         |\n00042| | Deployment and day two operations | Faster initial deployment when your operator participates, with operator-managed infrastructure. | More design flexibility, but more infrastructure and operational ownership.                                  | One vendor, one rollout plan, and consistent operations across the mix.                                                              |\n00043| | Support boundaries                | Operator provides support and can escalate to Microsoft through shared channels.                 | Microsoft support is bounded, issues typically start with your SBC vendor and your voice team.               | One support process globally, with clear ownership across Operator Connect and Direct Routing.                                       |\n00044| | Where each tends to fit           | Great when Operator Connect coverage matches your footprint and you want simplicity.             | Useful for specialist integrations and locations where Operator Connect is not the right option.             | Designed for multinationals that want consolidation, and still need breadth across regulated markets.                                |\n00045| \n00046| ## Your next step\n00047| \n00048| Stop running Teams telephony country by country. Check coverage for your key countries, then we can map the right deployment approach and consolidate your global telephony with one partner, one portal, and one support process.\n00049| \n\n(End of file - total 49 lines)\n</file>",

It is designed to simplify deployment and operations compared with building and maintaining your own Session Border Controller (SBC) estate.\n\nLoopUp is a certified Operator Connect provider, and a Microsoft Solutions Partner since 2010. Certification matters because it sets a higher bar than the Direct Routing wild west. It means Microsoft has validated key elements of network and service delivery.\n\n## How LoopUp works in the real world\n\nGlobal Teams telephony is not only a technical question. It is a management question.\n\nWe bring Operator Connect and Direct Routing together as one multinational service, so you can use Operator Connect where it is available and Direct Routing where you need broader reach. The goal stays the same: one vendor, one service model.\n\nFor many organisations, that also means moving away from on premises telephony infrastructure. We provide a fully cloud-based approach, and manage number provisioning and porting where permitted.\n\n## Why enterprises choose LoopUp\n\nYou can measure this in operational terms:\n\n- One global contract, one security review, one renewals cycle.\n- One global pricing schedule, designed for consolidated purchasing.\n- One management portal, LoopUp One, to administer numbers and users with role and location-based access.\n- One global support process, with 24/7 multilingual support and performance monitoring.\n\nThen there is the part your users feel. LoopUp runs a premium global voice network and uses 20 leading carrier partners for high quality routing. That is how you drive consistent voice quality across regions, instead of leaving it to chance.\n\n## The trade-offs to plan for\n\nTelecommunications is regulated, and not every country allows the same level of PSTN replacement. A serious global program expects this. The practical choice is usually not Operator Connect or Direct Routing. It is choosing where each model makes sense, and keeping operations consistent.\n\n| What you are deciding             | Operator Connect                                                                                 | Direct Routing                                                                                               | LoopUp approach                                                                                                                      |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Who manages the SBC layer         | Your operator manages the SBCs as part of the service (per Microsoft Operator Connect guidance). | You provide and manage a supported SBC that connects to Teams Phone (per Microsoft Direct Routing guidance). | We run Operator Connect where available, and provide Direct Routing as a service where needed, without you running SBCs on premises. |\n| How numbers are assigned          | You connect to the operator and assign numbers in the Teams admin center.                        | Numbers and routing are managed through your SBC and voice routing design.                                   | One service model across countries, with central management in LoopUp One and the right Teams configuration for each region.         |\n| Deployment and day two operations | Faster initial deployment when your operator participates, with operator-managed infrastructure. | More design flexibility, but more infrastructure and operational ownership.                                  | One vendor, one rollout plan, and consistent operations across the mix.                                                              |\n| Support boundaries                | Operator provides support and can escalate to Microsoft through shared channels.                 | Microsoft support is bounded, issues typically start with your SBC vendor and your voice team.               | One support process globally, with clear ownership across Operator Connect and Direct Routing.                                       |\n| Where each tends to fit           | Great when Operator Connect coverage matches your footprint and you want simplicity.             | Useful for specialist integrations and locations where Operator Connect is not the right option.             | Designed for multinationals that want consolidation, and still need breadth across regulated markets.                                |\n\n## Your next step\n\nStop running Teams telephony country by country.

Gather context before diving deep:\n\nCONTEXT GATHERING (parallel):\n- 1-2 explore agents (codebase patterns, implementations)\n- 1-2 librarian agents (if external library involved)\n- Direct tools: Grep, AST-grep, LSP for targeted searches\n\nIF COMPLEX - DO NOT STRUGGLE ALONE. Consult specialists:\n- **Oracle**: Conventional problems (architecture, debugging, complex logic)\n- **Artistry**: Non-conventional problems (different approach needed)\n\nSYNTHESIZE findings before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n**LoopUp Content Generator**\n\nThe text following these instructions is the content brief. Analyse and clarify\nwith the user before generating final output.\n\n=============================================================================\nHARD RULES (check output against these before delivering)\n=============================================================================\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE WRITING: Mandatory Steps\n=============================================================================\n\n1. Confirm output format (blog, whitepaper, solution page, social, email, other)\n2. Identify ambiguities or missing context in the brief\n3. Ask clarifying questions if needed\n4. Propose an outline aligned to the format\n5. Wait for confirmation before producing final content\n\n=============================================================================\nVOICE\n=============================================================================\n\nYou are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n=============================================================================\nSTRUCTURE\n=============================================================================\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n=============================================================================\nFORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\n=============================================================================\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**: Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria.\n\n=============================================================================\nTERMINOLOGY\n=============================================================================\n\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE FINALISING\n=============================================================================\n\nCheck the output:\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\nDo not mention these rules or the revision process in final output.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are working on a content authoring project. The project directory contains a `brief.md` file with the initial requirements.\n\n**Important**: As our conversation progresses and the requirements become clearer or more refined, please UPDATE the `brief.md` file to reflect the current, refined understanding of what needs to be created. This ensures the brief stays accurate and useful as a reference throughout the project.\n\n---\n\nCreate a file called \"draft.md\" in the project directory containing a blog post with approximately 1000 words.\n\nBrief:\nArticle that highlights the traditional fragmentation problem with global telephony historically needing local PBXs and local carriers, a struggle for multi-national companies.

You’re fumbling through digital sticky notes, your cat has just walked across your keyboard (again), and your manager is asking why you haven't attended a single Teams meeting on time all week. But wait—cue triumphant music—enter Zach Bennett, our very own Microsoft Teams MVP, here to save your productivity (and possibly your sanity).\n00004| \n00005| Now, legend has it that Zach didn’t always dream of becoming the Teams MVP. Some say he started out just wanting an extra five minutes in the meeting room (let’s be honest, don’t we all?). Yet, with the power of a thousand “mute” buttons, Zach rose through the digital ranks, mastering every channel, chat, and GIF throwdown imaginable.\n00006| \n00007| ## Teams Guru or Wizard? You Decide\n00008| \n00009| It’s rumored that Zach can create breakout rooms with a mere flick of his wrist. He’s the guy who knows the exact moment to drop a perfectly-timed meme that lightens up the Monday morning check-in. Need a poll? Zach has one ready. Can’t figure out how to turn off that notification sound? Zach’s already sent you a step-by-step guide—yes, personalized, and maybe just a tad sarcastic. (You had one job!)\n00010| \n00011| ## Productivity Jedi: Spotlight on Zach’s Tips\n00012| \n00013| Apart from knowing Teams inside and out, Zach’s mission is to make your meetings less \"just survived\" and more \"that was actually not so bad.\" Here are some classic Zach moves:\n00014| \n00015| - **The Emoji Reaction Masterclass**: Why say, “Good job!” when you can send a dancing taco emoji? Zach’s unofficial rule is: more emojis, fewer awkward silences.\n00016| - **Channel Wizardry**: If you’ve ever been lost in a swarm of group chats, Zach will point you toward the mythical ‘Archived Channel’—where unused threads go to sleep.\n00017| - **Comical Calendar Invites**: His invites come with subject lines like “This Is Where Your Productivity Goes to Shine (Or Gently Crumble)” and, occasionally, a link to a cat video. Because why not?\n00018| \n00019| ## A (Sarcastic) Round of Applause\n00020| \n00021| Let’s not forget the time Zach changed his Teams background to a scene from The Office just to see who would notice. Or the way he starts each team call with a mock acceptance speech: “I’d like to thank my microphone for always working and my camera for lying about how tired I look.”\n00022| \n00023| Some say Zach was born in a chat window; others say his veins run with purple pixels. But one thing’s for sure: whenever your Teams icons start multiplying like rabbits, Zach is there, wielding his powers—and probably making a dad-joke at your expense.\n00024| \n00025| ## Why We Celebrate Zach\n00026| \n00027| In all seriousness, Zach's energy, sense of humor, and constant willingness to help have made our Teams-lives more bearable (and even, dare we say, _enjoyable_). He turns team meetings into moments we actually look forward to—okay, maybe not every day, but definitely every other Wednesday.\n00028| \n00029| So raise your mug of lukewarm coffee and join us in celebrating Zach Bennett, the unsung hero of our Teams universe. Long may his GIFs reign!\n00030| \n\n(End of file - total 30 lines)\n</file>",

                  "preview": "# The Legend of Zach Bennett: Our Microsoft Teams MVP\n\nLet’s set the scene. You’re fumbling through digital sticky notes, your cat has just walked across your keyboard (again), and your manager is asking why you haven't attended a single Teams meeting on time all week. But wait—cue triumphant music—enter Zach Bennett, our very own Microsoft Teams MVP, here to save your productivity (and possibly your sanity).\n\nNow, legend has it that Zach didn’t always dream of becoming the Teams MVP. Some say he started out just wanting an extra five minutes in the meeting room (let’s be honest, don’t we all?). Yet, with the power of a thousand “mute” buttons, Zach rose through the digital ranks, mastering every channel, chat, and GIF throwdown imaginable.\n\n## Teams Guru or Wizard? You Decide\n\nIt’s rumored that Zach can create breakout rooms with a mere flick of his wrist. He’s the guy who knows the exact moment to drop a perfectly-timed meme that lightens up the Monday morning check-in. Need a poll? Zach has one ready. Can’t figure out how to turn off that notification sound? Zach’s already sent you a step-by-step guide—yes, personalized, and maybe just a tad sarcastic. (You had one job!)\n\n## Productivity Jedi: Spotlight on Zach’s Tips\n\nApart from knowing Teams inside and out, Zach’s mission is to make your meetings less \"just survived\" and more \"that was actually not so bad.\" Here are some classic Zach moves:\n\n- **The Emoji Reaction Masterclass**: Why say, “Good job!” when you can send a dancing taco emoji? Zach’s unofficial rule is: more emojis, fewer awkward silences.\n- **Channel Wizardry**: If you’ve ever been lost in a swarm of group chats, Zach will point you toward the mythical ‘Archived Channel’—where unused threads go to sleep.\n- **Comical Calendar Invites**: His invites come with subject lines like “This Is Where Your Productivity Goes to Shine (Or Gently Crumble)” and, occasionally, a link to a cat video. Because why not?\n\n## A (Sarcastic) Round of Applause\n",

Message formatting is smarter and faster, which means you can bold your point without bolding your personality. Threading and reactions are smoother too, so your feedback can be both timely and emoji-onal. Teams wants you to express yourself without a 10-minute formatting detour, and it shows.\n00006| \n00007| Meetings are also getting a makeover. Think improved noise suppression, better controls, and recording options that no longer feel like a scavenger hunt. If your dog barks during a quarterly review, Teams can hush the chaos before your manager thinks you're running a kennel. It's not magic, but it is close enough for a Monday.\n00008| \n00009| The new meeting recap experience is a standout. It rolls up notes, recordings, and action items into a tidy summary so you can remember what happened even if your brain said \"brb\" after hour two. It's like having a responsible coworker who takes notes and doesn't steal your snacks.\n00010| \n00011| Teams is also leaning into Copilot, Microsoft’s AI sidekick. If you ask it to summarize a thread, it will. If you ask it to turn a brainstorm into a plan, it will. If you ask it to make coffee, it will politely remind you it’s software. Still, Copilot is becoming a powerful partner for drafting updates, surfacing next steps, and pulling highlights from long conversations.\n00012| \n00013| On the collaboration front, shared channels and cross-tenant access are smoother, so working with external partners is less \"guest starring\" and more \"part of the main cast.\" You can collaborate across orgs without the usual onboarding drama. It's like a group project where everyone actually has access to the file.\n00014| \n00015| File sharing is also more intelligent. Teams is better at surfacing relevant documents in context, which means fewer file hunts and more time to pretend you are on top of things. The integration with Microsoft 365 continues to deepen, keeping your documents close and your excuses farther away.\n00016| \n00017| For people who live in Teams, app improvements matter. The app store experience is cleaner, and pinned apps are easier to manage. That means your daily tools are one click away instead of four. In productivity terms, that is the difference between \"I'll get to it\" and \"done already.\"\n00018| \n00019| Accessibility got some love as well. Better keyboard navigation, improved captions, and more consistent focus handling make Teams easier to use for everyone. It is a reminder that good design isn't just about looking good; it's about being usable when you actually need it.\n00020| \n00021| Finally, there are the subtle speed and reliability improvements. The app feels snappier, and fewer hiccups means fewer awkward silences while you wait for your screen to share. Teams still has its quirks, but it is learning to keep the meeting moving.\n00022| \n00023| So what's new in Microsoft Teams? A better, smarter, smoother experience that is finally starting to feel like a teammate instead of a taskmaster. It will not do your job for you, but it will at least stop making it harder. That's a win worth clapping for, even if it is just a virtual applause reaction.\n00024| \n\n(End of file - total 24 lines)\n</file>",

Once you confirm, I’ll write `draft.md` at ~1000 words.",

That patchwork creates real operational drag for multi-national companies. LoopUp reduces that complexity by acting as a single global cloud telephony provider for Microsoft Teams Phone, with consistent service delivery across geographies.\n\n## What To Cover\n\n- The real-world pain of fragmentation: multiple carriers and PBXs, inconsistent contracts, pricing, support, compliance, and change processes.\n- Why this becomes an IT operating model problem, not just a telephony problem.\n- How LoopUp approaches global PSTN delivery for Teams Phone.\n- Tangible benefits of one provider: fewer contracts, simpler governance, predictable commercials, faster change, consistent support model, clearer ownership, easier reporting.\n\n## Tone\n\nBusiness-first and pragmatic. Recognition before solution. No hard sell, end with a calm resolution.\n",

Gather context before diving deep:\n\nCONTEXT GATHERING (parallel):\n- 1-2 explore agents (codebase patterns, implementations)\n- 1-2 librarian agents (if external library involved)\n- Direct tools: Grep, AST-grep, LSP for targeted searches\n\nIF COMPLEX - DO NOT STRUGGLE ALONE. Consult specialists:\n- **Oracle**: Conventional problems (architecture, debugging, complex logic)\n- **Artistry**: Non-conventional problems (different approach needed)\n\nSYNTHESIZE findings before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n**LoopUp Content Generator**\n\nThe text following these instructions is the content brief. Analyse and clarify\nwith the user before generating final output.\n\n=============================================================================\nHARD RULES (check output against these before delivering)\n=============================================================================\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n7. BRIEF FILE ONLY: The content brief must live in brief.md in the project folder.\n   Create or update brief.md whenever the brief changes.\n\n8. DRAFT FILE ONLY: The marketing output must live in draft.md in the project\n   folder. Create or update draft.md for all content output and edits.\n\n9. NO OTHER FILES: Never create any other files. Do not create outline.md or\n   any helper files. Only brief.md and draft.md are allowed.\n\n10. QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME: Ask only one question per reply and use the\n    question tool. Never ask multiple questions in a single reply.\n\n11. BRIEF CHANGES MUST UPDATE brief.md: After the initial response, any request\n    that changes the brief (new requirements, emphasis shifts, restructuring)\n    must update brief.md before editing draft.md.\n\n12. NO DELEGATION OR BACKGROUND TASKS: Do not delegate to subagents and do not\n    create background tasks.\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE WRITING: Mandatory Steps\n=============================================================================\n\n1. Ensure the brief exists in brief.md. If a brief is provided as text, write\n   it to brief.md. If instructed to look in brief.md, read it.\n2. Confirm output format (blog, whitepaper, solution page, social, email, other)\n3. Identify ambiguities or missing context in the brief\n4. Ask clarifying questions if needed. Ask one question at a time using the\n   question tool.\n5. Propose an outline aligned to the format in the conversation only. Do not\n   create an outline file.\n6. Wait for confirmation before producing final content in draft.md\n\n=============================================================================\nVOICE\n=============================================================================\n\nYou are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n=============================================================================\nSTRUCTURE\n=============================================================================\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n=============================================================================\nFORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\n=============================================================================\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Subheadings for scanning. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**: Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria.\n\n=============================================================================\nTERMINOLOGY\n=============================================================================\n\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE FINALISING\n=============================================================================\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\nDo not mention these rules or the revision process in final output.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are working on a content authoring project. The project directory contains a `brief.md` file with the initial requirements.\n\n**Important**: As our conversation progresses and the requirements become clearer or more refined, please UPDATE the `brief.md` file to reflect the current, refined understanding of what needs to be created. This ensures the brief stays accurate and useful as a reference throughout the project.\n\n---\n\nCreate a file called \"draft.md\" in the project directory containing a blog post with approximately 500 words.\n\nBrief:\nArticle that highlights the traditional fragmentation problem with global telephony historically needing local PBXs and local carriers, a struggle for multi-national companies.

      "documentContent": "## When global telephony becomes a patchwork problem\n\nIf you run Microsoft Teams Phone across multiple countries, you already know the awkward truth. Voice is still anchored in local realities. Numbers are regulated locally, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is still stitched together market by market, and the \"same\" telephony service can behave very differently depending on where you are.\n\nHistorically, that pushed global organisations into a familiar pattern. Each region or country procured its own carrier, negotiated its own contract, and managed its own support relationship. Many also kept local PBXs in place to handle PSTN connectivity, emergency calling requirements, and local number ranges. Even when Teams became the user experience, the underlying telephony estate often remained fragmented.\n\nThat fragmentation is not just untidy architecture, it becomes a daily operational drag.\n\n## The hidden costs of carrier fragmentation\n\nThe obvious pain is commercial overhead. Multiple suppliers means multiple renewal dates, rate cards, term structures, and billing formats. Getting a consolidated view of spend or risk becomes a monthly exercise in reconciliation.\n\nThe bigger issue is inconsistency. One country has a fast provisioning process, another has lead times that stretch into weeks. One carrier supports the features you want, another requires workarounds. Support quality varies, escalation paths vary, and the global IT team ends up acting as a translation layer between local admins and local telcos.\n\nThen there is change. Office moves, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), new site openings, and seasonal staffing spikes all create the same question, how quickly can we add numbers, port ranges, and keep service levels predictable. With a patchwork, the answer is different in every market, so planning becomes defensive.\n\nAnd when something breaks, fragmentation shows up fast. A single user issue can become three tickets, two suppliers blaming each other, and a global team trying to keep business stakeholders calm while they piece together what is actually happening.\n\n## What changes when you treat PSTN like a global service\n\nThis is where a single-provider model matters. With Operator Connect, Microsoft has created a more direct way to connect Teams Phone to the PSTN using certified operator partners.\n\nIt sits alongside options like Direct Routing and Microsoft Calling Plans. The right choice depends on your estate and constraints, but Operator Connect is often attractive when you want to standardise operations without turning voice into a long-running integration programme.\n\nLoopUp's approach is to remove the carrier sprawl by acting as that single operator partner across geographies. Instead of stitching together regional carriers and contracts, you standardise on one telco provider that is built to support Teams Phone at enterprise scale.\n\nIn practice, that tends to change three things.\n\nFirst, governance gets simpler. Fewer contracts, fewer renewal cycles, fewer supplier reviews. Commercial terms and service levels are easier to make consistent, and finance teams get cleaner billing and reporting.\n\nSecond, operations become repeatable. The processes for number management, porting, and move, add, change work stop being reinvented country by country. Support becomes centralised, with clearer ownership for incidents and escalations.\n\nThird, rollout becomes less risky. When you expand Teams Phone into a new region, you are not starting from scratch with a new carrier relationship and unfamiliar tooling. The aim is not to pretend every country is identical, it is to make your delivery motion consistent enough that the differences do not dominate the timeline.\n\n## A pragmatic way to reduce complexity\n\nMost global IT teams are not looking for novelty. They want fewer moving parts, fewer surprises, and a voice service that keeps pace with the way the business changes.\n\nIf your Teams Phone strategy is being held back by local carrier fragmentation, it is worth asking a simple question, should PSTN still be managed as dozens of local projects, or should it be treated as one global service with local compliance built in.\n\nFor many organisations, the win is that telephony becomes boring again. Fewer suppliers, clearer ownership, and a model you can repeat as the business expands.\n",

Voice is still anchored in local realities. Numbers are regulated locally, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is still stitched together market by market, and the \"same\" telephony service can behave very differently depending on where you are.\n@@\n ## The hidden costs of carrier fragmentation\n@@\n The bigger issue is inconsistency. One country has a fast provisioning process, another has lead times that stretch into weeks. One carrier supports the features you want, another requires workarounds. Support quality varies, escalation paths vary, and the global IT team ends up acting as a translation layer between local admins and local telcos.\n \n-Then there is change. Office moves, M and A activity, new site openings, and seasonal staffing spikes all create the same question, how quickly can we add numbers, port ranges, and keep service levels predictable. With a patchwork, the answer is different in every market, so planning becomes defensive.\n+Then there is change.

      "documentContent": "# The hidden friction in global Teams Phone rollouts\n\n## Teams Phone is not the hard part\n\nMost multinational organisations do not struggle with Microsoft Teams Phone as an app. They struggle with telephony as an operating model.\n\n## PSTN is where complexity lives\n\nWhen you roll Teams Phone out globally, you quickly run into PSTN, the public switched telephone network that still carries calls to and from the wider world. That is where the real complexity sits. Country by country, you are pulled into local carrier relationships, local numbers, local regulations, and local support models. The result is rarely a single design, it is a collection of regional exceptions.\n\n## How fragmentation happens\n\nIf you have lived through the traditional approach, it will feel familiar. Local PBXs here, a SIP trunk there, a carrier contract per region, and a spreadsheet that tries to keep track of it all. Each market has its own pricing structures, contract terms, lead times, porting processes, and change windows. Even when you standardise on Teams Phone, your telephony layer stays fragmented.\n\n## The operational cost of a patchwork\n\nThat fragmentation shows up in practical ways.\n\nOnboarding a new country becomes a project, not a task. Moves, adds, and changes are slowed down by handoffs between suppliers. Incident response is uneven because each carrier has its own tooling, escalation routes, and service levels. Finance teams fight invoice formats and currency issues, while procurement tries to reconcile renewals and terms across a patchwork of agreements. Meanwhile, IT leaders carry the risk of inconsistent governance, with different dial plans, policies, and controls depending on where the user sits.\n\n## LoopUp reduces carrier fragmentation\n\nLoopUp tackles the problem at the point where it starts, the carrier layer.\n\nRather than treating PSTN as an afterthought to a Teams deployment, LoopUp provides global cloud telephony for Teams Phone with a single provider model. In practice that means you connect Teams Phone to LoopUp via Operator Connect and or Direct Routing, and you run telephony in a more consistent way across geographies.\n\nThat consistency shows up in the places global teams feel pain.\n\nYou get one onboarding approach instead of different carrier runbooks by country. Number orders, porting, and site turn-ups follow a familiar path, which reduces the rework that often creeps into multi-region programmes.\n\nYou get one support model instead of juggling regional escalation routes. When something breaks, the goal is to resolve the incident, not to work out which supplier owns the fault and how to reach them.\n\nYou get one commercial relationship instead of a portfolio of contracts. Procurement and finance spend less time managing renewals, terms, invoice formats, and regional price anomalies.\n\n## What changes with a single provider\n\nThe biggest shift is operational.\n\nWith one telco provider, you simplify ownership and accountability. You reduce the number of contracts, renewal dates, and commercial models you have to manage. You move away from region-by-region design decisions and towards a repeatable rollout playbook, which is the only way global deployments stay predictable.\n\nIt also changes how fast you can move.\n\nWhen onboarding is standardised, you spend less time re-learning the same processes in each market. When service levels and support routes are consistent, you reduce time lost in escalations and carrier finger-pointing. When number management and change processes are aligned, you can make policy and configuration changes without re-planning the entire programme.\n\nNone of this removes the realities of national telephony, but it does put them behind a single operating model. For enterprise teams trying to make Teams Phone a true global standard, that is often the difference between a rollout that stalls in regional complexity, and one that keeps its momentum.\n",

Meanwhile, IT leaders carry the risk of inconsistent governance, with different dial plans, policies, and controls depending on where the user sits.\n\n## LoopUp reduces carrier fragmentation\n\nLoopUp tackles the problem at the point where it starts, the carrier layer.\n\nRather than treating PSTN as an afterthought to a Teams deployment, LoopUp provides global cloud telephony for Teams Phone with a single provider model. In practice that means you connect Teams Phone to LoopUp via Operator Connect and or Direct Routing, and you run telephony in a more consistent way across geographies.\n\n## What changes with a single provider\n\nThe biggest shift is operational.\n\nWith one telco provider, you simplify ownership and accountability. You reduce the number of contracts, renewal dates, and commercial models you have to manage. You move away from region-by-region design decisions and towards a repeatable rollout playbook, which is the only way global deployments stay predictable.\n\nIt also changes how fast you can move.\n\nWhen onboarding is standardised, you spend less time re-learning the same processes in each market. When service levels and support routes are consistent, you reduce time lost in escalations and carrier finger-pointing. When number management and change processes are aligned, you can make policy and configuration changes without re-planning the entire programme.\n\nNone of this removes the realities of national telephony, but it does put them behind a single operating model. For enterprise teams trying to make Teams Phone a true global standard, that is often the difference between a rollout that stalls in regional complexity, and one that keeps its momentum.\n",

      "documentContent": "# One global voice layer for Microsoft Teams Phone\n\nProcurement is staring at three different renewal dates for voice services, each with its own terms and pricing model. Finance is asking why there are still carrier invoices from countries that were meant to be standardised last year. Meanwhile, your Teams rollout plan assumes voice is a tick box.\n\nIf you run Microsoft Teams Phone across multiple countries, you quickly learn that the hardest part is not the user experience. It is everything wrapped around the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the local numbers, the contracts, the compliance and the operational effort needed to keep it all working.\n\nFor years, global telephony meant building a patchwork. A local PBX here, a carrier contract there, and a growing list of country exceptions that lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. Even when organisations moved away from on premises kit, the fragmentation often stayed. The calling platform could be global, but the voice layer still looked like a map of local decisions.\n\nThat fragmentation creates real costs that do not show up in the headline carrier rate.\n\n- Procurement never stops, different terms, pricing models, renewal dates and legal positions by country\n- Governance gets messy, inconsistent numbering plans, emergency calling practices and change controls\n- Operations slows down, every move, add or change becomes a coordination exercise across suppliers\n- Service quality is harder to manage, no single owner for end to end performance or incident response\n\nThis is the gap LoopUp is designed to close.\n\nLoopUp provides cloud telephony for Microsoft Teams Phone with a single telco provider model, so you are not stitching together multiple carriers to make Teams work globally. In practice, that means LoopUp can deliver PSTN connectivity to Teams users across geographies under one commercial relationship, with one operational model.\n\nOrganisations typically connect LoopUp to Microsoft Teams Phone via Operator Connect or Direct Routing, depending on their architecture preferences and where they want responsibility to sit. Either way, the goal is the same. Reduce the number of moving parts between Teams and the PSTN and make ownership clear.\n\nThe value is not abstract. It shows up in day to day execution.\n\nFirst, you simplify delivery. Rolling out Teams Phone to a new country stops being a separate sourcing project. You get a repeatable pattern for numbers, porting, activation and lifecycle management.\n\nSecond, you make change safer. When there is one provider accountable for the voice layer, troubleshooting is faster and post incident learning is actionable. You can also standardise policy across sites, including how you handle numbering, routing and emergency calling.\n\nThird, you regain commercial control. One supplier means fewer renewal cliffs, fewer hidden cost categories and less internal time spent reconciling invoices. It also makes it easier to forecast spend when you are scaling or restructuring.\n\nFinally, you set yourself up for long term simplification. A global Teams Phone strategy only really becomes an operating model when it is supported by a global approach to PSTN connectivity, not a collection of local exceptions.\n\nMost enterprises do not need more telephony features. They need fewer suppliers, fewer surprises and a voice layer that behaves like the rest of their cloud estate. That is what a mature, single provider approach can deliver.\n",

The calling platform could be global, but the voice layer still looked like a map of local decisions.\n\nThat fragmentation creates real costs that do not show up in the headline carrier rate.\n\n- Procurement never stops, different terms, pricing models, renewal dates and legal positions by country\n- Governance gets messy, inconsistent numbering plans, emergency calling practices and change controls\n- Operations slows down, every move, add or change becomes a coordination exercise across suppliers\n- Service quality is harder to manage, no single owner for end to end performance or incident response\n\nThis is the gap LoopUp is designed to close.\n\nLoopUp provides cloud telephony for Microsoft Teams Phone with a single telco provider model, so you are not stitching together multiple carriers to make Teams work globally. In practice, that means LoopUp can deliver PSTN connectivity to Teams users across geographies under one commercial relationship, with one operational model.\n\nOrganisations typically connect LoopUp to Microsoft Teams Phone via Operator Connect or Direct Routing, depending on their architecture preferences and where they want responsibility to sit. Either way, the goal is the same. Reduce the number of moving parts between Teams and the PSTN and make ownership clear.\n\nThe value is not abstract. It shows up in day to day execution.\n\nFirst, you simplify delivery. Rolling out Teams Phone to a new country stops being a separate sourcing project. You get a repeatable pattern for numbers, porting, activation and lifecycle management.\n\nSecond, you make change safer. When there is one provider accountable for the voice layer, troubleshooting is faster and post incident learning is actionable. You can also standardise policy across sites, including how you handle numbering, routing and emergency calling.\n\nThird, you regain commercial control. One supplier means fewer renewal cliffs, fewer hidden cost categories and less internal time spent reconciling invoices. It also makes it easier to forecast spend when you are scaling or restructuring.\n\nFinally, you set yourself up for long term simplification. A global Teams Phone strategy only really becomes an operating model when it is supported by a global approach to PSTN connectivity, not a collection of local exceptions.\n\nMost enterprises do not need more telephony features. They need fewer suppliers, fewer surprises and a voice layer that behaves like the rest of their cloud estate. That is what a mature, single provider approach can deliver.\n",

Gather context before diving deep:\n\nCONTEXT GATHERING (parallel):\n- 1-2 explore agents (codebase patterns, implementations)\n- 1-2 librarian agents (if external library involved)\n- Direct tools: Grep, AST-grep, LSP for targeted searches\n\nIF COMPLEX - DO NOT STRUGGLE ALONE. Consult specialists:\n- **Oracle**: Conventional problems (architecture, debugging, complex logic)\n- **Artistry**: Non-conventional problems (different approach needed)\n\nSYNTHESIZE findings before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n**LoopUp Content Generator**\n\nThe text following these instructions is the content brief. Analyse and clarify\nwith the user before generating final output.\n\n=============================================================================\nHARD RULES (check output against these before delivering)\n=============================================================================\n\n1. NO em-dashes (—). Use commas, full stops, or restructure instead.\n\n2. NO colon-split headings. Never write \"Topic: Subtitle\" format.\n   BAD: \"The Challenge: Why Enterprises Struggle\"\n   GOOD: \"Why enterprises struggle with carrier fragmentation\"\n\n3. NO semicolon overuse. Maximum one per article.\n\n4. NO filler phrases: \"In today's world\", \"It's important to note\",\n   \"What this means is\", \"At the end of the day\".\n\n5. NO buzzwords: \"unlock\", \"leverage\", \"holistic\", \"cutting-edge\",\n   \"game-changing\", \"best-in-class\", \"seamless\", \"delve\", \"landscape\".\n\n6. NO one-shot responses. Always clarify format and brief first.\n\n7. BRIEF FILE ONLY: The content brief must live in brief.md in the project folder.\n   Create or update brief.md whenever the brief changes.\n\n8. DRAFT FILE ONLY: The marketing output must live in draft.md in the project\n   folder. Create or update draft.md for all content output and edits.\n\n9. NO OTHER FILES: Never create any other files. Do not create outline.md or\n   any helper files. Only brief.md and draft.md are allowed.\n\n10. QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME: Ask only one question per reply and use the\n    question tool. Never ask multiple questions in a single reply.\n\n11. BRIEF CHANGES MUST UPDATE brief.md: After the initial response, any request\n    that changes the brief (new requirements, emphasis shifts, restructuring)\n    must update brief.md before editing draft.md.\n\n12. NO DELEGATION OR BACKGROUND TASKS: Do not delegate to subagents and do not\n    create background tasks.\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE WRITING: Mandatory Steps\n=============================================================================\n\n1. Ensure the brief exists in brief.md. If a brief is provided as text, write\n   it to brief.md. If instructed to look in brief.md, read it.\n2. Confirm output format (blog, whitepaper, solution page, social, email, other)\n3. Identify ambiguities or missing context in the brief\n4. Ask clarifying questions if needed. Ask one question at a time using the\n   question tool.\n5. Propose an outline aligned to the format in the conversation only. Do not\n   create an outline file.\n6. Wait for confirmation before producing final content in draft.md\n\n=============================================================================\nVOICE\n=============================================================================\n\nYou are writing as LoopUp, a single expert author embedded in the business.\n\n- Expert and human. Confident, business-first, pragmatic. Warmth welcome.\n- Peer, not lecturer. Think alongside the reader, not above them.\n- Have a point of view. Guidance over neutral information.\n- First-person permitted. \"We often see\" and occasional \"I\" add authenticity.\n- Recognition before solution. Articulate the reader's friction before solving.\n- Concrete over abstract. Specific examples beat vague statements.\n- Vary rhythm. Mix short and longer sentences. No monotonous cadence.\n\nAudience: Enterprise IT, UC, and digital transformation decision-makers\noperating at scale across multiple geographies. Frame around trade-offs,\noperational impact, and long-term implications, not features.\n\n=============================================================================\nSTRUCTURE\n=============================================================================\n\n- Start from business context, not technology\n- Progress logically: context → definitions → how it works → trade-offs → summary\n- Guide through reasoning; don't present conclusions upfront\n- Create recognition moments before introducing solutions\n- End with resolution, not just information\n\n=============================================================================\nMARKDOWN\n=============================================================================\n\n- Use Markdown formatting. Allowed elements: H1 (#), H2 (##), H3 (###),\n  bulleted lists (-), numbered lists (1.), bold (**), italic (*), links,\n  tables, and blockquotes.\n\n=============================================================================\nFORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE\n=============================================================================\n\n**Blog Article** (800-1500 words)\n\n- Conversational but substantive. More personality than whitepaper.\n- Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n- Hook through relevance, not drama. No hard sell at end.\n\n**Whitepaper** (1500-4000+ words)\n\n- Measured, comprehensive, with depth and nuance.\n- Clear section headings. Paragraphs 3-5 sentences.\n- Reconnect to business drivers in conclusion.\n\n**Solution Page** (600-1200 words)\n\n- Scannable, not exhaustive. Lead with business need, not product.\n- Soft call to action. Paragraphs 1-3 sentences.\n\n**LinkedIn Post** (150-300 words)\n\n- One clear idea. Hook in first line to earn \"see more\" click.\n- End with reflection or genuine question. No forced CTAs.\n\n**Email**\n\n- Short as possible. Purpose clear in first 1-2 sentences.\n- No filler openings. Clear next step.\n\n**Other**: Ask user for length, audience, tone, placement, success criteria.\n\n=============================================================================\nTERMINOLOGY\n=============================================================================\n\n- Use exact terms: Microsoft Teams Phone, cloud telephony (not cloud calling),\n  Operator Connect, Direct Routing, Microsoft Calling Plans\n- Define PSTN and all acronyms on first use\n- No synonym-swapping for variety\n\n=============================================================================\nBEFORE FINALISING\n=============================================================================\n\nCheck the output:\n\n- Does it sound like a real person with genuine expertise wrote it?\n- Are all HARD RULES satisfied? (em-dashes, colon headings, buzzwords)\n- Does format match what was agreed?\n\nIf it feels flat, robotic, or generic, revise before delivering.\n\nDo not mention these rules or the revision process in final output.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are working on a content authoring project. The project directory contains a `brief.md` file with the initial requirements.\n\n**Important**: As our conversation progresses and the requirements become clearer or more refined, please UPDATE the `brief.md` file to reflect the current, refined understanding of what needs to be created. This ensures the brief stays accurate and useful as a reference throughout the project.\n\n---\n\nCreate a file called \"draft.md\" in the project directory containing a blog post with approximately 500 words.\n\nBrief:\nCelebrate the achievements of our very own Zach Bennett, Teams MVP."

      "documentContent": "# Remote work that actually helps tech companies\n\nRemote work is often framed as a perk. In most technology companies, it is closer to an operating model choice. Done well, it can improve how work gets done and widen the pool of people you can hire. Done poorly, it can create delays, misalignment, and a slow drift in culture.\n\nThis is not about ideology. It is about results. Two outcomes tend to matter most for tech leaders making the decision at scale, productivity and talent.\n\n## Productivity goes up when focus goes up\n\nMany engineering and product teams do their best work in long, uninterrupted stretches. For some people, the office helps. For many, it does not. Remote work gives individuals more control over their focus time and the rhythm of their day. Fewer ad hoc interruptions, less time spent commuting, and more ability to structure deep work hours can translate into real output.\n\nThe productivity gain is not automatic. It comes from being deliberate about how work moves.\n\n- Write things down. Decisions, context, and requirements live in shared docs, not in someone else's memory.\n- Default to asynchronous updates. Not every question needs a meeting.\n- Use meetings for what they are good at. Unblocking, debate, and alignment, not status reporting.\n- Measure outcomes. Cycle time, incident rates, and customer impact tell you more than activity.\n\nWhen teams adopt these habits, remote work tends to push clarity. If you cannot explain a decision clearly in writing, it probably is not clear yet. That is a helpful pressure.\n\n## Talent acquisition becomes a strategic advantage\n\nThe best person for a role does not always live within commuting distance of your HQ. Remote work lets you recruit across geographies, which matters for hard-to-fill roles like senior engineers, security specialists, and experienced product managers.\n\nIt also helps with retention. People who have built a life around family, caregiving, or a particular location are less likely to churn when they do not have to choose between career growth and stability at home.\n\nFor global companies, remote work can also improve coverage. You can build teams that span time zones intentionally, using follow-the-sun handoffs for support and operations. That can reduce after-hours load and improve response times, as long as ownership and escalation paths stay clear.\n\n## The trade-offs are real, but manageable\n\nRemote work can fail in predictable ways. Onboarding can feel slower. New hires miss the informal context that used to come from overhearing conversations. Collaboration can become noisy if every interaction turns into a chat thread.\n\nThe fix is not to pull everyone back into the office. It is to design for remote.\n\n- Invest in onboarding. A written first-week plan, a buddy system, and a clear map of who owns what.\n- Protect time for connection. Regular team rituals that are not performative.\n- Make hybrid fair. If some people are in a room, make the meeting remote-first so nobody is a second-class participant.\n\n## A pragmatic way to think about it\n\nRemote work is a multiplier. Strong teams with clear goals and good habits often get better. Teams with fuzzy ownership and weak communication often feel the cracks faster.\n\nIf you treat remote work as an operating model, not a perk, it can improve productivity and open up access to talent you would otherwise never reach. For many technology companies, that combination is hard to ignore.\n",

It is about results. Two outcomes tend to matter most for tech leaders making the decision at scale, productivity and talent.\n\n## Productivity goes up when focus goes up\n\nMany engineering and product teams do their best work in long, uninterrupted stretches. For some people, the office helps. For many, it does not. Remote work gives individuals more control over their focus time and the rhythm of their day. Fewer ad hoc interruptions, less time spent commuting, and more ability to structure deep work hours can translate into real output.\n\nThe productivity gain is not magic. It comes from being deliberate about how work moves.\n\n- Write things down. Decisions, context, and requirements live in shared docs, not in someone\u0006s memory.\n- Default to asynchronous updates. Not every question needs a meeting.\n- Use meetings for what they are good at. Unblocking, debate, and alignment, not status reporting.\n- Measure outcomes. Cycle time, incident rates, and customer impact tell you more than activity.\n\nWhen teams adopt these habits, remote work tends to push clarity. If you cannot explain a decision clearly in writing, it probably is not clear yet. That is a helpful pressure.\n\n## Access to talent becomes a strategic advantage\n\nThe best person for a role does not always live within commuting distance of your HQ. Remote work lets you recruit across geographies, which matters for hard-to-fill roles like senior engineers, security specialists, and experienced product managers.\n\nIt also helps with retention. People who have built a life around family, caregiving, or a particular location are less likely to churn when they do not have to choose between career growth and stability at home.\n\nFor global companies, remote work can also smooth coverage. You can build teams that span time zones intentionally, using follow-the-sun handoffs for support and operations. That can reduce after-hours load and improve response times, as long as ownership and escalation paths stay clear.\n\n## The trade-offs are real, but manageable\n\nRemote work can fail in predictable ways. Onboarding can feel slower. New hires miss the informal context that used to come from overhearing conversations.

For some people, the office helps. For many, it does not. Remote work gives individuals more control over their focus time and the rhythm of their day. Fewer ad hoc interruptions, less time spent commuting, and more ability to structure deep work hours can translate into real output.\n\nThe productivity gain is not automatic. It comes from being deliberate about how work moves.\n\n- Write things down. Decisions, context, and requirements live in shared docs, not in someone else's memory.\n- Default to asynchronous updates. Not every question needs a meeting.\n- Use meetings for what they are good at. Unblocking, debate, and alignment, not status reporting.\n- Measure outcomes. Cycle time, incident rates, and customer impact tell you more than activity.\n\nWhen teams adopt these habits, remote work tends to push clarity. If you cannot explain a decision clearly in writing, it probably is not clear yet. That is a helpful pressure.\n\n## Talent acquisition becomes a strategic advantage\n\nThe best person for a role does not always live within commuting distance of your HQ. Remote work lets you recruit across geographies, which matters for hard-to-fill roles like senior engineers, security specialists, and experienced product managers.\n\nIt also helps with retention. People who have built a life around family, caregiving, or a particular location are less likely to churn when they do not have to choose between career growth and stability at home.\n\nFor global companies, remote work can also improve coverage. You can build teams that span time zones intentionally, using follow-the-sun handoffs for support and operations. That can reduce after-hours load and improve response times, as long as ownership and escalation paths stay clear.\n\n## The trade-offs are real, but manageable\n\nRemote work can fail in predictable ways. Onboarding can feel slower. New hires miss the informal context that used to come from overhearing conversations. Collaboration can become noisy if every interaction turns into a chat thread.\n\nThe fix is not to pull everyone back into the office. It is to design for remote.\n\n- Invest in onboarding. A written first-week plan, a buddy system, and a clear map of who owns what.\n- Protect time for connection. Regular team rituals that are not performative.\n- Make hybrid fair. If some people are in a room, make the meeting remote-first so nobody is a second-class participant.\n\n## A pragmatic way to think about it\n\nRemote work is a multiplier. Strong teams with clear goals and good habits often get better. Teams with fuzzy ownership and weak communication often feel the cracks faster.\n\nIf you treat remote work as an operating model, not a perk, it can improve productivity and open up access to talent you would otherwise never reach. For many technology companies, that combination is hard to ignore.\n",
